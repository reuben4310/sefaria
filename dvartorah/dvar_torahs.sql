(1, 0, 'In Parshas Bereshis, we learn many important lessons, but none more powerful and enduring than the significance and holiness of words and speech. The Torah teaches us that God created the world through ten utterances: through Divine speech. With each holy command, our universe was formed. Hashem implanted this gift of speech within man. Of all earth’s creatures, only humans are endowed with the ability to verbally communicate intelligently. We must be ever mindful that, even as God created through “words,” on our own level, we too create through words./\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime and again, the Torah cautions us to be very careful with that which escapes our lips, for, as King Solomon tells us, “Death and life are in the tongue.” Before speaking, stop for a moment and consider how your words impact others. What sort of environment and relationships do you create with your speech? Do you speak to your family and friends with love and respect? Do you think about what you’re saying before you say it and the effect that it will have on those with whom you communicate? How careful are you with that which escapes from your lips?/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more commandments in the Torah in regard to speech than to any other mitzvah: seventeen negative and fourteen positive mitzvos. It is through speech that we signaled our commitment to our Covenant at Sinai when we proclaimed, “Na’aseh V’nishma — We shall do it and we shall study it.” It is through speech — prayer — that we speak to God on a daily basis, bringing a positive spiritual influence into the mundane. Yet speech can have terribly negative effects as well: It was through speech that Hitler committed the most unspeakable evil ever to be perpetrated upon mankind. He himself never lifted a weapon; he used his lethal tongue to incite the world to hatred and slaughter. Indeed, “Death and life are in the tongue.”/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThink before you speak and ask yourself, “Will my words generate light or darkness, love or hatred, blessing or curse?” The choice is yours to make. Use your Divine gift of speech carefully and wisely, in the service of the Almighty.'),

(3, 1, 'Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; make the ark with compartments, and cover it inside and out with pitch. (Genesis 6:14)\r\n\r\nDaniel calls up his contractor and says, \"I just bought a sizeable piece of land and would like you to build me a magnificent house. I would like the kitchen counters to be made from the finest granite...\"\r\n\r\nThe contractor interrupts, \"Woah! Just slow down a little! First, we need to deal with the zoning, write up the blueprints and get a building permit. Then we\'ll begin with the details; how many floors and what type of materials. We have plenty of time until we begin discussing the kitchen counters...!\"\r\n\r\nGod commanded Noah to build an ark. He gave Noah the building plans for the ark: make an ark of gopher wood and make many rooms. The ark should be covered inside and out with pitch. It should be 300 cubits in length, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. He then proceeds to the details, telling him how many floors there should be and where the window and door should be placed. It seems that the command to make \"many rooms\" is really out of place. God should\'ve first finished explaining the basic structure before he told him about the \"many rooms\"!\r\n\r\nNow, if the main reason Daniel decided to build a new house was that he could not tolerate his kitchen counters, which were poor quality and looked terrible, then we would understand why one of the first things he mentioned was the counters. After all, that\'s why he wanted to move.\r\n\r\nThe same concept applies to the ark. The behavior of the people was so corrupt that it affected the animals as well until they too cohabited with other species. God, therefore, decided to destroy the world and start it over from scratch. Since His reason for destroying the world was because of the corruption it would make sense that the first thing He would care about in rebuilding the world was that it not get corrupt again; hence came the commandment to make many different rooms, since all the animals needed to be kept separate from other species.\r\n\r\nWhen a person turns over a new leaf and wants to change, he begins working hard and growing, but can often find himself falling back into the same hole. For example, a person switches schools to get away from bad influences, and yet before he knows it he\'s hanging out with the same type of crowd once again. The first step in the growing process is to create some plan to ensure the mistake doesn\'t repeat itself. Failing to plan is planning to fail.'),
(4, 2, 'And God said to Avram, go for yourself from your land, from your relatives, and from your father\'s house to the land that I will show you. (Gen. 12:1)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah portion begins with Avraham\'s first trial: to give up his entire past and follow God\'s lead to a new land: God said to Avram, \"Go for yourself from your land, from your relatives, and from your father\'s house to the land that I will show you.\" When a person leaves his hometown, he first leaves his father\'s house, then his neighborhood (his relatives), and then his country. Why does the verse list these in the opposite order?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person makes a physical departure, he first leaves his father\'s house, then his relatives, and then his country. However, the verse is alluding to Avraham\'s departure in a spiritual sense. \"Leaving your hometown\" means changing your old ways and leaving behind your bad habits. Therefore, the order in the verse is reversed, starting with the easier things. The culture of a person\'s country is not so deeply ingrained, and so it can be uprooted relatively easily. More difficult is to get rid of bad habits a person acquired amongst his social circle and friends. Finally, to shake off bad traits acquired at home is very challenging./\r\n\r\nThe Sfas Emes quotes the Zohar, which states that God called out \"Go for yourself,\" in every generation, but Avraham was the only one to respond to God\'s call. God still calls out \"go for yourself\" today, and we need to respond. We must distance ourselves from bad habits and serve God even though it may require inconvenience or hardship.'),
(5, 3, 'Avraham came forward and said, “Will You also stamp out the righteous along with the wicked?”. (18:23)/\r\n\r\nGod revealed to Avraham his plan to destroy Sodom. As soon as Avraham heard the news he began praying for its survival. What is difficult to understand is that Sodom’s lifestyle was diametrically opposed to Avraham’s way of life and teachings. Avraham was the epitome of chesed (loving kindness). His whole life revolved around helping others. However, in Sodom chesed was considered a crime! One could get executed for just giving charity to a pauper. Why then did Avraham pray on behalf of the corrupt inhabitants of Sodom?/\r\n\r\nOften people preach kindness, but they get angry and hate those who dispute their values. This is because their kindness is coming from the love that they have for themselves. They are trying to build up their own confidence and self-esteem. Avraham’s kindness was based on his love for other people. It is true that the people of Sodom were doing wicked acts, but Avraham loved them and therefore anger and animosity did not play a role in whether or not to pray for them./\r\n\r\nWhen doing acts of kindness out of love the kindness will continue even when it’s hard and difficult for you, such as when a person takes care of his children even when it’s difficult. His love for his child overrides any personal feelings he may have. Furthermore, this type of selfless kindness can really help someone grow and become a greater person. Similarly, the Talmud relates that there were thugs frequenting R’ Meir’s neighborhood. They caused R’ Meir so much aggravation that he prayed they should die. R’ Meir’s wife, Bruria, said to him, “Instead of praying for their deaths pray that they should repent!” R’ Meir prayed on their behalf and they returned to God.'),

(7, 4, '[Avraham says to Eliezer] \"And I will have you swear by Hashem, God of heaven and God of earth, that you not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.\" (Gen. 24:3)/\r\n\r\nAfter the Akeida, Avraham resolved to seek a wife for Yitzchak. He sent Eliezer on the mission but told him that he did not want to take a wife for Yitzchak from the Canaanites, nor from the seven nations. Avraham did not trust Eliezer and therefore had him swear. The difficulty with this is that the previous verse mentions that Eliezer was in charge of all of Avraham\'s assets. Avraham had complete trust in him. Why then does Avraham not trust him when it comes to finding his son a wife?/\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to spiritual matters, people generally trust one another. If one sees a man with a beard eating in a restaurant, he\'ll eat there without further inquiry. If someone tells him, \"I think it\'s okay to do such and such,\" he\'ll do it in a second without asking further. However, when it comes to the mundane, people will research and seek many opinions before finalizing their purchase. Just because a car dealer says \"Trust me...\" it won\'t satisfy them./\r\n\r\nWe see from Avraham the exact opposite. When it came to his money, he put Eliezer fully in charge and trusted all his decisions. However, in spiritual matters, where Yitzchak\'s mate had to be the next Sarah - a woman who would not only be a wife but also a matriarch - for that he did not trust Eliezer.(1)/\r\n\r\nRabbi Yisrael Salanter was once traveling to a distant city. On the way, he passed a small town and decided to rest in one of the inns. The innkeeper, sensing that his guest was a devout Jew, approached Rabbi Salanter and asked: \"Excuse me, but would you happen to be a shochet (a ritual slaughterer)? I have a cow in the barn that needs to be slaughtered. I usually go to our neighboring town to have it slaughtered. If you are a shochet then you can save me a big trip.\"/\r\n\r\nRabbi Salanter responded, \"I am not a shochet.\"/\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, Rabbi Salanter approached the innkeeper and asked, \"Perhaps you would be kind enough to lend me some money?\"/\r\n\r\n\"Give you a loan?\" replied the innkeeper in surprise., \"Bbut I don\'t even know you! How can I trust you to pay me back?\"/\r\n\r\n\"Listen to what you just said,\" said Rabbi Salanter. \"When it came to loaning me money - even a small amount - you would not trust me as I am a stranger to you. Yet when you wanted to slaughter your cow, you were prepared to rely on me though you have absolutely no idea who I am! Shechita (kosher slaughter) involves many intricate Jewish laws. Why were you so sure that I possess enough fear of heaven to be a proper shochet...?!\"'),
(8, 4, 'Chai shara'),
(9, 5, 'And Eisav said, \"Look, I am going to die, so of what use to me is the birthright?\" ...And Eisav spurned the birthright. (Gen. 25:32)/\r\n\r\nEisav came home from the field exhausted and noticed Yaakov cooking up a stew. \"Pour some of that red stuff down my throat for I am starving\", Eisav exclaimed. Yaakov replied, \"I\'ll sell it to you for the birthright.\" Eisav said, \"Look I am going to die, so of what use to me is the birthright?\" After he sold the birthright to Yaakov, the verse tells us that Eisav looked at the birthright with disdain./\r\n\r\nRashi explains that Eisav feared the birthright since he knew that the birthright entailed responsibilities such as performing the service in the Holy Temple, and if there were any shortcomings in his performance he could be punished with death. If so, why was he considered to have treated the birthright with disdain by selling it? On the contrary, he was showing the importance of the birthright and the dignity in which the service must be conducted!?/\r\n\r\nIn the course of life, God \"throws\" us many opportunities which can make us greater. He gives us an opening to start a great project or a position where we can influence and elevate others. The Torah is telling us not to let these opportunities slip away. Don\'t say, \"It\'s too hard for me,\" or \"I\'ll do it tomorrow...\" Eisav had the opportunity to do the service of the birthright and gave it up. The Torah considers the passing up of such an opportunity a disgrace! When an opportunity comes your way - grab it, and enjoy the ride to greatness!'),
(10, 5, 'toldos'),
(11, 6, 'And whatever You will give me, I shall repeatedly tithe it to you. (Gen. 28:22)/\r\n\r\nThe Shulchan Aruch states that one is required to take a tenth of what he earns and give it to charity. We see from Yaakov that giving a tithe to charity is not limited to money - it actually includes anything that God gives you. Yaakov says to God, \"Whatever you shall give me, I shall repeatedly tithe it to you.\" You are required to share with others any talents or knowledge that God has granted you. Just like God gave you money to be able to help others, He gives positive attributes and qualities so that you can help others./\r\n\r\nIndeed, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated that a Jew should tithe his time, contributing a portion of his time to the service of worthy causes. A poor woman once visited the home of Rabbi Feinstein, and requested a meeting with him. \"Why do you need to speak with the Rabbi?\" asked one of the members of Rabbi Feinstein\'s family./\r\n\r\n\"I received a letter from my sister who lives in Russia,\" the woman said. \"I would like the Rabbi to translate it for me.\"/\r\n\r\n\"For this you have to come to the Rabbi?\" asked the relative. \"Rabbi Feinstein cannot be bothered with such things!\"/\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked the woman. \"He has been translating these letters for me for the last 20 years.\"/\r\n\r\nReb Moshe, who was an extremely busy man, gave of his time in order to help this poor woman!/\r\n\r\nUsing God given talents to lord over others is arrogant and wrong. Someone that is musically talented or has a high IQ has to recognize that this was given to him for the sake of benefitting others.'),
(12, 7, 'Rescue me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eisav. (32:12)/\r\n\r\nYaakov was on the road travelling when he received the message that his brother Eisav was heading towards him with 400 men. A frightened Yaakov prays to God, \"Rescue me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eisav.\" Why did Yaakov repeat himself in describing Eisav? He should have said, \"Rescue me from Eisav,\" or \"Rescue me from my brother.\" What was the purpose of using both terms?/\r\n\r\nYaakov\'s fear was two-pronged. He was afraid that \"Eisav\" would act with enmity and threaten his physical survival. He also feared the spiritual danger of greeting Eisav as his brother. He feared that Eisav would have a negative influence on his family if they ended up making peace. He therefore prayed to God to save him from both outcomes./\r\n\r\nRemarkably, Yaakov prayed for his spiritual well-being before he prayed to be saved from physical danger! He was more concerned over the negative influence that Eisav may have on him than he was concerned for his life!/\r\n\r\nBy nature, people adapt their behavior to their surroundings; they begin to think and act like their neighbors. Hence, it is imperative that one keeps distance from evil people, while befriending righteous people and emulating them.'),
(13, 8, 'Behold! A caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, their camels bearing spices, balsam, and lotus - on their way to bring them down to Egypt. (Gen. 37:25)/\r\n\r\nRashi explains that Ishmaelite caravans normally carry foul-smelling spices, but in order to spare the righteous Joseph from the offensive odor, God arranged that this caravan carried fragrant spices. We learn from this the great reward that the righteous enjoy./\r\n\r\nImagine a man who was arrested and is about to be transported to a prison which houses dangerous criminals. The officer sees him shaking like a leaf and tells him \"Don\'t worry - there is some good news - the bus that\'s transporting you to prison has a good smell!\" The man stares at the officer in amazement. The last thing he cares about is how his transportation to prison smells!/\r\n\r\nJoseph was being sold as a slave. The last thing he cared about was the aroma; all he wanted was to be freed. How does the presence of spices show us the great reward that the righteous enjoy?/\r\n\r\nA young boy wakes up and finds himself in a car driven by a man he does not know. He realizes that he has been kidnapped! He starts crying for his parents, only to be ignored - causing him to cry even harder. The man stops the car and says, \"We are going to eat now.\" The little boy opens up the platter and is shocked to see that the food is the same thing that he eats every day, in the exact same way that his mother prepares it for him. He realizes that it must be that his mother sent this food and she must have arranged this whole ride. He hasn\'t been kidnapped; he\'s in safe hands! He stops crying and immediately feels at ease. He feels great!/\r\n\r\nJoseph\'s brothers wanted to execute him. He was thrown into a pit feeling abandoned and lost. He was sold to a caravan of Ishmaelites who always had foul-smelling wagons. However, this time there was a pleasant smell. He understood the message: God was telling him that all of these events were part of the plan: \"Don\'t worry, I\'m holding your hand the whole way through.\"/\r\n\r\nSometimes we may go through very hard periods, but throughout them, we see seemingly random events that appear unusual - almost like a miracle. It\'s God telling us, \"Don\'t worry, I\'m orchestrating all these events and there\'s a plan behind everything. You\'re in safe hands!\"'),
(14, 9, 'Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying, \"That is beyond me; it is God who will respond with Pharaoh\'s welfare.\" (Gen. 41:16)/\r\n\r\nYosef was only 17 years old when his brothers threw him into a pit filled with snakes and scorpions. He was sold four times and ended up as a slave in Egypt, a country filled with immorality. Nevertheless, Yosef\'s spirit remained strong. His master\'s wife tempted him every single day for a year, but he fought off his evil inclination. One day she grabbed him. He pulled himself away and ran out of the house. His master\'s wife placed the blame on him and Yosef landed in jail. Is that Yosef\'s reward for fighting his desires? Imprisonment?! He spent many years in prison, not knowing if he would ever be a free man again. Yet, Yosef\'s faith in God did not waver./\r\n\r\nAfter 12 years in prison, he was summoned to Pharaoh. He was given a golden opportunity to attain freedom. If only he would appease Pharaoh he could start life anew. Yosef knew that Pharaoh did not believe in God - he believed that he himself was God. Pharaoh said to him, \"I heard that you know how to interpret dreams.\" Yosef replied, \"I\'m sorry, you have the wrong person, God is the one that interprets dreams\". By saying this he could have lost this opportunity and been thrown back into the dungeon! He could have justified himself in thinking that now was not the right time to attribute everything to God. And yet he did not hesitate to attribute all of his talents to God!/\r\n\r\nA person must see God\'s hand in every situation and realize that there\'s a master plan, even at times when it is hard to comprehend. For example, you decide to start learning Torah every day before Shacharis. The next morning, you go out to the car bright and early, turn the key and nothing happens. The car is dead. You think to yourself \"Why now? I don\'t deserve this! I am only doing this for you - God!\" We have to learn from Yosef. Yosef\'s faith in God was iron-clad in every situation; whether his brothers wanted to kill him or whether he was thrown into prison for defeating his evil inclination, he understood that everything was for his good.'),
(15, 10, 'Yosef harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Yisrael his father in Goshen. He appeared before him, fell on his neck, and he wept on his neck excessively. (Gen. 46:29)/\r\n\r\nYaakov was informed that his long-lost son, whom he had not seen for 22 years, was alive and well and ruling Egypt. Overjoyed he headed down to Egypt to see him. Yosef went out to greet his father, falling on his neck weeping. Yaakov, however, did not fall on Yosef\'s neck, nor did he kiss him. Why not? The Midrash reveals that Yaakov was reciting Shema. Of all the times to say the Shema, he had to say it now - when he was finally reunited with his long-lost son!? Couldn\'t he have had better itinerary planning? And if it was now the halachic time to say Shema, why didn\'t Yosef say it as well?/\r\n\r\nEmotions can be channeled in different ways. An actor who feels anxious and tense before a play can channel those feelings into high-powered energy and produce an incredible performance. The same is true for channeling our emotions to the service of God. When Yaakov saw Yosef after a long and painful separation, he experienced an outpouring of love and joy. He felt that instead of focusing purely on the joy of seeing his son, he should channel this love towards God, and so he immediately recited Shema./\r\n\r\nCharacter traits can also be redirected to better serve God. We find that both King David and Eisav were born with a tendency towards bloodshed. David utilized it for the good - he killed only in accordance with the rulings of the Sanhedrin, thus fulfilling God\'s will. Eisav, on the other hand, would kill whenever the mood moved him and became the eternal symbol of cruelty and evil./\r\n\r\nGod created man with the ability to experience many emotions, and He wants us to use them to get closer to Him. How sad it is when people cry watching movies, wasting their precious tears on something that never even happened! The Talmud states, \"If a person encounters the evil inclination, he should drag him into the Beis Hamidrash (study hall).\" The Ben Yehoyada explains, \"If a sudden wave of physical desire overcomes a person, \"He should bring it to the Bais Midrash\" - instead of using the desire for something negative, he should hurry to utilize this energy for spiritual pursuits - the performance of a mitzva or the study of Torah.'),
(16, 11, 'Reuven, you are my firstborn... Due to the hastiness like water, you cannot be foremost, since you disarranged your father\'s bed. (Gen. 49:3-4)/\r\n\r\nIn this week\'s Parsha, Yaakov rebukes his oldest son, Reuven: \"Due to the hastiness with which you rushed to let out your anger (in the incident with Bilhah when you mounted your father\'s bed), you lost your right to the status of first-born. It was a hasty recklessness like that of fast-flowing waters which rush ahead and cause damage without a thought to the consequences.\"/\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand this, for Reuven did not mean to sin; to the contrary, he thought he was acting righteously, defending his mother\'s honor. Furthermore, Reuven repented sincerely, and was held up as a model of sincere repentance. Why then was he punished so severely, losing his status as the first-born and leader?/\r\n\r\nRav Moshe Feinstein was once being taken in a car by a student from his Yeshivah. As Reb Moshe entered the car the student closed the door on his fingers, yet Reb Moshe remained completely silent as if nothing had happened. When a bewildered onlooker asked him why he did not cry out, he answered that the student would have felt incredible embarrassment about having caused him pain, and therefore he controlled himself and kept quiet./\r\n\r\nReuven forfeited these privileges not because of his actions but because of what caused him to act the way he did - the attribute of impulsiveness. A leader cannot be impulsive. He must think through his decisions and consider their consequences. One first has to take responsibility for himself before he can take responsibility for others. To act without first thinking is a sign that one is not in control of himself and not fit to be a leader.'),
(17, 12, 'She opened it and saw him, the boy, and behold! A youth was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew boys.” (Exodus 2:6)/\r\n\r\nPharaoh’s daughter went to bathe by the river and noticed a little casket floating in the water. The verse states that she opened the casket and saw the “yeled”, boy, and behold a “naar”, youth, was crying. She then realized that it was a Jewish baby. Why does the verse switch from boy to youth, and how did she work out that it was a Jewish baby just because he was crying?/\r\n\r\nThe Baal Haturim explains that the verse is actually referring to two separate individuals. She opened the casket and saw the boy – Moshe. She then noticed that the youth was crying – Aharon. When she saw one brother crying for another she realized that it must be a Jew!/\r\n\r\nThe Rebbe of Kapishnitz (R’ Avraham Yehoshua Heschel), once visited one of his wealthy followers. The Rebbe knocked on the door. The wealthy man opened his door and was taken aback at the sight of the holy Rebbe standing at his door step. He asked in bewilderment, “Why did the Rebbe have to trouble himself to come to my home? The Rebbe could have summoned me and I would have come at once!”/\r\n\r\nThe Rebbe answered, “I know of a certain family that is in desperate need of help. The husband is without work, and, to add to their hardship, they have a son who is ill and requires special medical attention. Their expenses are well beyond their means.”/\r\n\r\n“But Rebbe,” the wealthy man said, “did this necessitate you having to exert yourself by traveling to my home? Why did the Rebbe not simply send me a messenger, and I would have gladly given whatever sum of money that was needed!” “This particular request is of great importance to me,” the Rebbe responded. “It was therefore essential that I come to your home personally.”/\r\n\r\n“I am prepared to give as much money as necessary!” the man exclaimed. “Just tell me, whom shall I make the check payable to?” The Rebbe paused and said, “Make the check payable… to your brother!!”/\r\n\r\nOften one wants to help others and searches far and wide for opportunities to do so, but he may find himself ignoring his own family members. A way to test whether you really care about others or whether you’re helping them just for recognition is by examining the way you help at home. Real kindness starts with your own brother!'),
(18, 13, 'This was the Aaron and Moshe... (Ex. 6:26)/\r\n\r\nRashi notes that in some places the Torah mentions Moshe before Aharon and in other places (such as our verse) it mentions Aharon before Moshe. This teaches us that both were equally great./\r\n\r\nThis is puzzling, since the Torah itself testifies that Moshe was the greatest prophet who ever lived; how can it be said that Aharon was equal to him?/\r\n\r\nIn God\'s eyes, achievement is measured by whether a person fulfills his personal mission. One who has a small mission but completes it is just as great as one with a big mission who completes it. Aharon achieved the absolute maximum of his potential; he fulfilled God\'s will perfectly just as Moshe did. The difference was that Moshe had more missions, which meant that he had more responsibilities. Still, since they both did as they were commanded in accordance with their abilities, they were on an equal level./\r\n\r\nPeople can tend to get disheartened that they cannot accomplish as much as their peers. If a person doesn\'t have the intelligence and capabilities of others, he has to understand that more talent simply means greater responsibility. Rav Yisroel Salanter used to say: \"I know that in many ways I have the capacity of 1,000 men, but because of this, my obligation to serve Hashem is also that of one thousand men.\" As long as one is maximizing his potential he is just as great as everyone else.'),
(19, 14, 'And so that you may relate in the ears of your son and your son\'s son that I made mockery of Egypt and my signs that I placed among them - that you may know that I am Hashem. (Ex. 10:2)/\r\n\r\nGod sent 10 plagues to the Egyptians. If the purpose of the plagues was to compel Pharaoh to send the Jews from Egypt, why couldn\'t one massive plague suffice?/\r\n\r\nWhen one makes food for his own consumption, he knows exactly what he wants. He knows the type of food, the quantity and the spices that he likes. However, when one makes food to sell he doesn\'t know everyone\'s taste so he needs to make a variety of dishes to ensure that there will be something for everyone./\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the plagues was to teach the children of Israel, as well as all future generations, that God is not a distant, uninterested Creator - rather, He is the master and sustainer of the universe day by day. The people were to relate all the miracles to their children, and their children to their children and so on. Since different people are impressed and amazed by different things, God performed a variety of miracles to ensure that everyone would be impressed and pass it down to the next generation./\r\n\r\nEvery person has his own personality and own way of looking at things. Some children have a more creative mind while others have an easier time remembering information. Every child is fascinated by something else. Hence, every child needs to be raised accordingly. We should not expect to fit them all in to a standard \"cookie cutter,\" - we should rather tailor their education to suit their individual needs.'),
(20, 15, 'It happened on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they did not find. (Ex. 16:27)/\r\n\r\nAfter Moses said that no manna would fall on Shabbos, Dasan and Aviram tried to trick the people into thinking that the manna had fallen on Shabbos by scattering some on the ground at sunrise. Birds came and ate all the manna they had spread before the Bnei Yisroel woke up. Had the people seen even a small amount of manna on Shabbos after Moses had said that it wouldn\'t fall might have caused a tremendous amount of confusion, which could have led to a rebellion against Moses. Once a year we show appreciation to the birds by feeding them bread./\r\n\r\nBirds naturally eat. By eating all the manna they didn\'t do anything that goes against their nature. In fact they didn\'t even know that they were doing a great kindness, they just saw bread and ate it. Why then do we reward them yearly?/\r\n\r\nIt is true that birds eat, and eating the manna was not an act against their nature. However, because the eating of the manna was favorable for us, we need to be grateful for it. Being grateful is not dependent on what drove the benefactor to do the act; rather it is for the one receiving the kindness to show appreciation - regardless of the intentions of the giver./\r\n\r\nFocusing on what you\'re lacking leads to misery. When one has a sore throat he can focus on his throat - which will then make him gloomy, or he can focus on the fact that he\'s breathing fine, his business is going smooth... On average, 90% of things in our life are good. The key to happiness is to be appreciative - focus on the 90%!'),
(21, 16, 'And Israel encamped there, opposite the mountain. (Ex. 19:2)/\r\n\r\nIn the Pesach Haggadah it states, \"Had He (God) brought us before Har Sinai, but not given us the Torah, it would have been sufficient.\" These words are difficult to understand, for what would simply arriving at Har Sinai accomplish if it would not have resulted in our receiving the Torah?/\r\n\r\nRashi points out that the word \"vayichan\" is in the singular, despite the fact that the Torah was describing the encampment of millions of Jews. Rashi explains that at this particular encampment the Jewish people were united - \"as one man, with one heart.\" Upon arriving in the desert of Sinai, they put an end to all quarrelling, cleansing their hearts from all ill will, and they shared a deep love for one another. The unity that the Jewish people achieved would have been worthwhile even had they not received the Torah!/\r\n\r\nFor Israel to rise to its highest calling, for us to reach perfection, we must act as one entity and not as a bunch of individuals. Furthermore, when people are united, God does not harm them. As we see in the story of the tower of Babel, the Torah tells us that God said, \"Behold, they are one people with one language for all.\" Since they were united God did not destroy them. Instead, He said, \"Come let us descend there and confuse their language.\" Because they could not understand each other, the builders of the tower began to fight, became untied, and Hashem then harmed them./\r\n\r\nUnity comes about when one puts his personal worries to the side and concerns himself with his friend. The difference between united and untied is where you place the \"I\". When you place the \"I\" to the side and you are more concerned for your friend - unity is the result.'),
(22, 17, 'If you take your fellow\'s garment as security, until sunset shall you return it to him. ...so it will be that if he cries out to Me, I shall listen, for I am compassionate. (Ex. 22:25-26)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah commands us to lend money to our fellow Jews. If the borrower does not repay, the lender may ask the court that he be given an item as collateral. However, the lender must return the collateral to the borrower at the times when he needs it. If the lender does not return it, he will be punished since God listens to the cries of the borrower./\r\n\r\nOne may ask: the lender has rights to an object of the borrowers. He needs to insure that he gets his money back. What then is the sin of not returning the collateral to the borrower when he needs it - the lender should be able to demand his money back if the borrower has to have his collateral?/\r\n\r\nGod gives a person more than what he needs for survival, merely for helping and giving to others. A person must look at the spare money he has as a deposit from God to assist the needy. Therefore, in a sense the lender has an obligation to lend out his extra money and doesn\'t deserve any collateral for it. However, the Torah has given him rights to take collateral so that he can keep lending his money to others. Still, when the borrower needs the coat the lender has to return it - out of the knowledge that nothing, even his own possession, is truly his./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud(2) relates that Turnus Rufus, the Roman Governor of Judea, asked Rabbi Akiva: \"If your God loves the poor, why does He not support them?\" Rabbi Akiva replied, \"So that we may be saved from the punishment of Hell by giving charity.\" God gives me extra so that I can gain by helping others. With this in mind, when someone comes and asks to borrow something, instead of making up a poor excuse try lending it out and saying \"Thank you for giving me this opportunity!\"'),
(23, 18, 'You shall make a menorah of pure gold, hammered out shall the menorah be made. (Ex. 25:31)/\r\n\r\nGod commanded Moshe to make a menorah by fashioning it out of a single bar of gold. Moshe could not visualize the menorah, and so God showed him a vision of a menorah of fire. However, Moshe still found it difficult to make. God then told him to throw the bar of gold into the fire, give it one blow with the hammer, and a finished menorah would emerge! Moshe threw the gold into the fire, hit it with the hammer and prayed to Hashem. Immediately, the complete menorah emerged from the fire. There is an obvious difficulty with this: if God knew that Moshe was not going to be able to actually make the menorah by himself, why did He show him the heavenly vision first?/\r\n\r\nWhen you get into your car and you turn on the G.P.S. the first instruction is: ENTER YOUR DESTINATION. In order to get anywhere in life, you need to have a goal; a vision of where you are heading. You have to first know what you want, before it can happen. Similarly, you can\'t pray and expect heavenly assistance if you don\'t have a clear vision of what you are looking for. Therefore, God had to show Moshe a vision of what he was supposed to accomplish, and only then could Moshe pray for heavenly assistance in the making of the menorah./\r\n\r\nThe Alter of Kelm explains how righteous people of previous generations became such great people. It was because they knew the power of setting goals, and had visions of what they aspired to reach. The evil inclination is able to persuade someone to sin by placing immoral fantasies in his mind. The only way to fight him is by using his own weapon against him - one needs to use the imagination to envision greatness. A person can learn mussar but still retain his flaws. In order to really change, one needs to envision the great person he would like to be. When the great sage Rebbe Akiva Eiger was asked how he became who he was, he replied that he strove to become like the Rashba (a great Rabbi who lived hundreds of years before him), and therefore he was able to become Rebbe Eiger. A person should always aim higher - shoot for the sky, for if you fall you will land amongst the stars!'),

(Ex. 28:33)/\r\n\r\nThe Me\'il (mantle) worn by the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) had attached to its bottom hem 72 ornaments in the shape of pomegranates alternating with 72 golden bells. These bells tinkled to announce the Kohen Gadol\'s arrival in the Mishkan and his departure from it./\r\n\r\nWe learn from the fact that the Kohen Gadol\'s entry was announced by bells that a person should not enter his own home unexpectedly. This shows us the importance of being sensitive and respectful to other people./\r\n\r\nThe Mishnah in Avos (4:3) states \"Do not be scornful of any person.\" One must not insult people, verbally or otherwise. Even the most inferior person must be treated respectfully, regardless of whether you understand their issues or not./\r\n\r\nThe key to interpersonal relationships is to try and place yourself in your friends\' shoes and see things from his perspective. For example, when it\'s hot outside and your roommate insists on the window being closed at night, try to understand his concerns - catching a cold and waking up sick the next morning. When your manager screams at you for not meeting the deadline, before you get insulted and begin to resent him, realize he must be under tremendous pressure. You\'ll understand him for acting the way he did since you would probably act the same way if you were under that much pressure!/\r\n\r\nBeing sensitive to others can sometimes raise their spirits and affect their lives in a big way. \"Although it\'s nice to be important, it\'s more important to be nice!\"'),
(25, 20, 'However, you must observe my Shabbos, for it is a sign between Me and you for your generations, to know that I am Hashem, Who makes you holy. (Ex. 31:13)/\r\n\r\nThe verse states that Shabbos is a sign between us and God. What does it mean that Shabbos is a \"sign\"?/\r\n\r\nImagine that it\'s been a long day and you barely ate anything. You hop over to the pizza shop and the lights are off - the store is closed. \"Interesting,\" you think to yourself, \"they are never closed at this time.\" A few days later you pass by in the morning and again it\'s closed. You figure that the owner must be away on vacation. A week later it\'s still closed. You assume that they must be renovating. One day you pass by and you see that the sign \"Delicious Pizza\" has been removed. You now understand that the store has closed down. Once the sign is removed you know it no longer exists./\r\n\r\nShabbos is the cornerstone of our faith and is equivalent to all of the commandments, for through the commandment of Shabbos one expresses his belief that God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Observing Shabbos indicates that one believes in the Creator. When one desecrates Shabbos he\'s removing his sign of being a believing Jew./\r\n\r\nShabbos helps us understand our place in the world. During the week human beings are busy building and changing the world. Every seven days we stop, we pull back from building the world and remind ourselves that we are not God. In ceasing from all creative activity we make the statement to ourselves and to humanity that although we can manipulate the world, we don\'t own it; the universe belongs to God./\r\n\r\nShabbos is not a day of restrictions; it\'s a day of opportunity. It\'s a day you can sit back knowing that you\'re in God\'s hands and that everything is being taken care of for you. It\'s a day that enables you to refresh, reconnect and reJEWvenate.'),
(26, 21, 'Every man whose heart inspired him came... (Ex. 35:21)/\r\n\r\nMoshe called upon the people to assist in the construction of the mishkan, the tabernacle. The skills needed for this job included weaving, sewing and building. Despite this, the Jewish people seemed to have no problem in fulfilling their tasks. The backbreaking labor to which the people had been subjected in Egypt did not develop these skills. Where did they acquire the skills necessary?/\r\n\r\nDeep inside every person there are hidden talents which can be tapped into when one has a real desire to achieve something. The people who stepped forward to work in the mishkan did not know that they had such skills. However, as a result of their burning desire to be of assistance, they found untapped talents and hidden abilities that were used to fulfill their tasks./\r\n\r\nRashi\'s daughter came home one night crying. Her 7-year-old son asked her, \"Mommy, why are you crying?\" She replied, \"The light of the world just went out; your grandfather Rashi passed away.\"/\r\n\r\nThe little boy thought for a moment and said, \"Mommy, I\'m going to re-ignite that light!\" This little boy grew up to become known as Rabbeinu Tam, the most famous of the Tosafists!/\r\n\r\nSometime a person may feel that he is inadequate, thinking, \"I am just not cut out for this,\" or \"I don\'t have the brains...\" He may well be lacking something else - the desire to succeed. If someone has a strong will to accomplish something, he will achieve it. We have the ability to break beyond our limits and achieve the seemingly impossible - if there is a will.'),
(27, 22, '\"These are the reckonings of the mishkan, the mishkan of testimony, which were reckoned at Moshe\'s bidding.\" (Ex. 38:21)/\r\n\r\nThe mishkan and all its holy vessels were completed. Moshe gave the Jewish People a calculation of how he had used every single ounce of gold, silver and copper which had been contributed. The verse opens, \"These are the reckonings...\" which implies that this was considered counting, while some other instance of reckoning was not considered a counting.(1) What is this reckoning coming to reject?/\r\n\r\nThe verse is telling us that the only meaningful use of money is for building God\'s sanctuaries or for other heavenly purposes. Only such investments are eternal; others are transitory.(2) When a person dies, his Torah and mitzvos accompany him and provide him merits in the world to come, but the money which he spent all his life working for will be left behind./\r\n\r\nBefore dying, Baron Rothschild handed his children two letters. He instructed them to open one immediately following his death, and the second a month later. They opened the first letter and discovered the following message: \"My last request is that I should be buried wearing my socks.\" Even though his children were perplexed by such a request, they still tried to honor it. They fought hard, but the Rabbis would not allow it and buried him without his socks. After the month had passed, his children anxiously opened up the second letter to discover another message: \"I know that you did not bury me wearing my socks as I had requested, since it is against Halacha, Jewish Law. You are most probably wondering why, then, did I request it in the first place. My answer to you, my dear children, is to teach you an eternal lesson: a person can spend his life amassing a great amount of possessions and money, but no matter how hard he tries, he cannot even take his socks with him to the next world! Only the money which he used for Torah and mitzvos will accompany him.\"'),
(28, 23, 'For you shall not cause to go up in smoke from any leavening or fruit-honey as a fire-offering to Hashem. You shall salt every meal- offering… (2:11, 13)/\r\n\r\nThe verse states that one is not permitted to use honey in the meal offering, while it is an obligation to use salt for all the offerings. Why is one obligated to bring salt as part of a sacrifice, as opposed to honey?/\r\n\r\nEven though honey and salt are both used for flavoring food there is a fundamental difference between them. Honey itself is sweet and when poured on food, it provides the food with a sweet taste. Salt, however, enhances flavor, pulling the flavor out of food and giving it a stronger taste. It can be added to something bland and make it flavorful./\r\n\r\nThe symbolism of the obligation to use salt on the offerings as opposed to honey teaches us that God wants every person to develop and nurture his own unique talents. This is like a good teacher who doesn’t merely put information into the student - rather he brings out and develops what’s already there./\r\n\r\nThe Zohar states that the word “Yisrael” is an acronym for there are six hundred thousand letters in the Torah. This number corresponds to the six hundred thousand men who left Egypt. Every Jew is a letter in the Torah. If there is one letter in a Torah scroll that is touching another letter that Torah is invalid, and so too, a Jew who ignores his own abilities and tries to be like others is ‘invalid’. Everyone needs to serve God in his own unique way. Don’t imitate others; rather locate qualities within yourself, ‘salt’ them, and let them shine.'),
(29, 24, 'his is the law of the feast peace-offering that one will offer to Hashem: If he shall offer it for a thanksgiving-offering...

This offering can be eaten for up to one day and one night./\r\n\r\nA thanksgiving offering is a form of Korban Shelamim (peace offering), so why isn\'t it eaten for two days and a night like all other peace offerings?/\r\n\r\nWe are surrounded by miracles all day long. In the Shemoneh Esrei we say, \"Thank you God for Your miracles that are with us every day.\" One who brings a thanksgiving offering has become aware of one solitary miracle while remaining oblivious to all the others. Therefore, a thanksgiving offering may be eaten for only one day since tomorrow there will be other miracles for which to be grateful!/\r\n\r\nGod is constantly performing miracles, whether they are obvious or hidden. We are surrounded by them. When flying in an airplane or just crossing the street, God holds our hand and saves us from possible danger. A Czarist official in Russia once asked the Netziv, Rabbi of Volozhin, why many verses in Tehillim (Psalms) call upon the nations to praise God for his salvation of Israel. Should it not be the Jews who praise God for saving them?! The Netziv replied, \"We have no way of knowing the extent of your conspiracies against us. Only you know how many times you have plotted against us, but have been thwarted by God. Since you are far more conscious than we are of the magnitude of God\'s miraculous salvations, only you can appreciate the full extent of His greatness.\"'),
(30, 25, 'These shall you abominate from among the birds, they may not be eaten - they are an abomination: the Chassidah. (Lev. 11:13)/\r\n\r\nAmong the non-kosher birds is the chassidah - the stork. It is called chassidah because it displays kindness (chessed) toward others of its species by sharing food with them. According to the Ramban, the reason why the non-kosher birds are not kosher is because of their cruel nature. If so, the chassidah should have been a kosher bird - after all, it bestows kindness upon its companions!/\r\n\r\nMan finds it easy to love his fellow man if they are similar. If he learns in my school, if he dresses like I do, then I love him and I\'ll try to assist him whenever the need arises. If he\'s not like me, then I have no business with him and have no interest in helping him. However, the kosher form of chessed is to bestow kindness equally on all people, regardless of how similar they are to us. The chassidah acts kindly toward its companions, but only towards its companions. It does not act kindly towards anyone else. To Jews, that is not an admirable characteristic./\r\n\r\nMany great people were known for their love and care for every single Jew, whether they wore a black hat, white kippah or no kippah. Being kind to just your own kind is not kosher!');

(31, 26, 'If a tzaraas affliction will be in a person... (Lev. 13:9)/\r\n\r\nLashon hara (negative speech) is a very serious sin and results in the transgressor being afflicted with tzaraas, a leprosy-like illness. Why is the sin of lashon hara so severe that it must be punished with tzaraas?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah states, \"And [God] blew into his nostrils the soul of life; and man became a living being.\" (Bereishis 2:7) Onkelos translates \"a living being\" as a \"speaking spirit.\" Accordingly, it is the soul that gives a person the power to speak. Because the soul and the ability to speak are directly connected, great damage is done to the soul when someone sins through speech. Lashon hara is therefore punished severely and instantaneously./\r\n\r\nRabban Shimon ben Gamliel once sent his servant, Tavi, to buy \"good food.\" Tavi, who was famous for his wisdom, brought back a tongue. Thereupon, Rav Shimon sent him to buy some \"bad food.\" Again he returned with a tongue. Rav Shimon asked him to explain how the same food could be both good and bad. Tavi answered, \"From a tongue can come good and bad. When a tongue speaks good, by complimenting or praising another, there is nothing better. But when a tongue speaks evil, when it tells lashon hara or makes fun of people, there is nothing worse. It can break up families and kill./\r\n\r\nThe verse states, \"Death and life are in the hands of the tongue.\" (Mishlei 18:21) The tongue is mightier than the sword. A sword can only kill someone nearby, whereas words spoken on one continent can \"hit the heart\" of someone on another continent. The tongue, of all the limbs and organs, moves with the least difficulty and most speed. Consequently, lashon hara is one of the sins committed most frequently. It is for this reason that the mouth is guarded with two gates: the teeth and the lips. A person has to think twice before he says something once. A bird that escapes may be caught again, but a word that escapes will never return!'),
(32, 27, 'The person being purified shall immerse his clothing, shave off all his hair, and immerse himself in the water and become pure. (Lev. 14:8)/\r\n\r\nOne of the stages in the purification process of the metzora is tevilah (immersion) in a mikveh. The Chinuch explains that in the beginning the world was submerged in water. Thus when the metzora immerses in the mikveh he feels like he has been created anew. He feels like a new person with a clean slate, leaving all his sins behind and starting over./\r\n\r\nFailure is part of the growth process. The key to success is to put the past behind you and start again while using your failures as tools to achieve your goals.\r\n\r\nMany accomplished people have had a hard road up the mountain of success, but all you see in the press are their victories. Michael Jordan, possibly the greatest basketball player of all time, is described as \"single-handedly redefining the NBA superstar,\" and yet to get there he admits to failing more than most. He is quoted as saying: \"I\'ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I\'ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty six times I\'ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I\'ve failed over and over and over in my life.\"/\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say the reason he has succeeded boils down to his constant failure and using failure as his motivation to shoot for success. In other words, Jordan viewed failures as stepping stones towards success; his shooting average was just below 50% so to score he would have to take two shots, one to miss and the other to score./\r\n\r\nDo you despair from your failures or view them as a chance for a rebound?'),
(33, 28, 'Aaron shall come to the tent of meeting - he shall remove the linen vestments that he had worn when he entered the sanctuary... He shall immerse himself in the water in a sacred place and don his vestments. (Lev. 18:23,24)/\r\n\r\nOn Yom Kippur while performing the service in the Kodesh Kodoshim (holy of holies), the Kohen Gadol would wear special white linen garments. Whenever he would don those white vestments or change into his regular vestments he immersed himself in a mikveh. One normally immerses when he\'s in the process of elevating himself. If so, why did the Kohen Gadol immerse himself when he changed back into his regular vestments - wasn\'t he decreasing his level of holiness by changing back into his regular clothes?/\r\n\r\nEvery good deed is supposed to elevate a person and bring him to new heights. Every Yom Tov that passes is not another Yom Tov gone - it\'s another Yom Tov in your pocket. The special qualities of that particular Yom Tov are supposed to bring you to a different plane and make you into a changed person. All the commandments you perform should be on a higher level than before.\r\nAfter the Kohen Gadol wore the holy white garments he became so elevated that even the regular service he performed afterwards was on a higher level. The regular service went up a notch and he therefore immersed himself before donning his regular vestments./\r\n\r\nIn life a person needs to keep climbing to greater heights. His understanding of Judaism needs to be constantly deepened and not remain stagnant. His performance in mitzvot and appreciation for prayer should be advancing constantly.'),
(34, 29, 'You shall reprove your fellow and do not bear a sin because of him. (Lev. 19:17)/\r\n\r\nThe Talmud (1) teaches that one must reprove over and over, even a hundred times. It may be unwise to tell someone bluntly how wrong his actions are, for it will probably antagonize him. How, then, do we understand this statement from the Talmud which requires us to reprove our fellow a hundred times?/\r\n\r\nPeople abhor criticism. No one enjoys hearing that what they\'re doing is wrong. In order to give rebuke in the correct manner one must have a proper strategy. By telling us to rebuke even a hundred times, our Sages are teaching us how to give rebuke: one should break up the criticism into a hundred small parts. This way a person can draw the object of rebuke closer to his point of view in a palatable way, one step at a time. Only in this manner will the person be able to hear that what he\'s doing is wrong, and thus be willing to effect a change./\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is important to have the right attitude when giving rebuke. If your intention is to set him straight only because it is bothering you, your rebuke will almost certainly fail./\r\n\r\nA Rabbi once told over a story about a student in the Chofetz Chaim\'s yeshiva who used to smoke on Shabbos. All the guys would scream at him to stop, but it was to no avail. One day he got a message that the Chofetz Chaim wanted to see him in the office. There was a big commotion in the yeshiva - the Chofetz Chaim had found out that he was smoking on Shabbos! The student went into the office, and came out two minutes later. After that, he never touched a cigarette again. No one knew what the Chofetz Chaim had told him, but in two minutes he accomplished something that throughout the years no one else had been able to accomplish!/\r\n\r\nAfter the Rabbi finished speaking, an elderly man came over and said \"I was the boy that was caught smoking on Shabbos.\" The Rabbi asked, \"So what did the Chofetz Chaim tell you?\" The man replied, \"When I was called into the office, I started to tremble; I didn\'t know what to say. I came into the office and there the Chofetz Chaim was. My feet started to shake. He motioned for me to come around the desk. I came around and he held on to my hand, not saying anything. He then looked at me and just said two words slowly: \'Shabbos Shabbos.\' As he spoke, two tears dripped down from his eyes on to my arm, which pierced a hole right through my heart! He wasn\'t just telling me off, like I felt everyone else was doing. Rather, I could see that he really cared about me and the honor of Shabbos. I decided right then and there never to smoke on Shabbos again!\"/\r\n\r\nThis is the way one gives rebuke. We need to analyze our motives before giving reproof and work on really feeling for the person.'),
(35, 30, 'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: God\'s appointed festivals… For six days labor may be done, and the seventh day is a day of complete rest. (Lev. 23:2)/\r\n\r\nGod is about to teach Moshe the laws of the festivals. Right before it lists the festivals the Torah mentions Shabbos. Why does the Torah introduce the chapter of festivals with Shabbos?/\r\n\r\nThere are two steps to emunah (belief). The first step is knowing that the world has a Creator. One has to know that at first there was nothing, until God spoke and brought all of reality into being. The second step is to know that God is involved in the actual running of the world. Every issue - whether big or small - involves Hashem. He is orchestrating all events at all times./\r\n\r\nShabbos bears testimony to the fact that God created heaven and earth, while the festivals, which recall the miracles of the exodus, testify that God controls nature on an ongoing basis and can change it at will. By placing Shabbos together with the festivals the Torah is teaching us that both concepts are equally essential to the faith of a Jew. Belief in one step without the other is not considered emunah. It is heretical to think that God created the universe, but then \"stepped back\" and left it to the unfettered laws of nature or in the control of angels or other powers. Emunah is knowing that God is the Creator and Sustainer.'),

God bestows blessings of bounty upon such an individual: in the sixth year his field produces enough food to last for three years - the sixth, seventh and eighth years. Why is the farmer considered a mighty warrior if he has plenty of food for himself and his family?/\r\n\r\nDaniel walked into a suit store and tried on a few different suits, but the prices exceeded his $300 budget. Also, he could see nothing he particularly liked, so he headed for the door. On his way out a salesman said, \"Hey, wait a minute! We\'ll find you something just perfect.\" He brought over a suit that Daniel had already tried on, but Daniel agreed to try it on again. The salesman looked at him and said, \"Wow, this suit looks really good on you. It fits like a glove. You look really slick!\"/\r\n\r\nDaniel took a look in the mirror and started to think, \"Two minutes ago I didn\'t like it, but now it\'s starting to look really nice.\" He asked the salesman the price./\r\n\r\nThe salesman told him, \"It\'s $400.\" After a pause, he added, \"Listen, this suit is made from the finest materials; you won\'t find this anywhere else...\"/\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Daniel walked out of the store with a big smile thinking he had bought the nicest suit in town… Even though everyone knows that salesmen are just trying to make a sale, we are still easily convinced by them./\r\n\r\nIn the sixth year, when a person\'s field produces three times the normal amount, the evil inclination comes knocking on his door and says, \"You have an incredible field. In one year it produced three times the normal amount. Next year you\'ll work the field and then it will produce 3 times the amount as well! Before you know it you\'ll be rich! To stop working your field now for a full year would be extremely foolish.\" Deep down the person knows that his field produced so much because of the Torah\'s promise, but the evil inclination sounds so convincing. Someone that can overcome such a challenge is a mighty warrior!/ \r\n\r\nHuman beings are very easily influenced and affected by surroundings and peer pressure. We change our minds from one minute to the next.

(37, 32, 'Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand. (Lev. 26:8)/\r\n\r\nThe Parshah begins with the blessings that await the Jewish people if they keep their covenant with God: five Jews will pursue a hundred enemies, and a hundred Jews will pursue 10,000. Rashi asks: if five Jews can pursue a hundred enemies, a ratio of 1:20, then shouldn\'t one hundred Jews pursue 2,000, not 10,000?/\r\n\r\nIt is said that if one person can lift 50 pounds, two people together can lift three times that amount: 150 pounds. As the verse states, \"Two are better than one.\" Two people together can accomplish a lot more than just two individuals. When more people are united in serving God their actions are more effective. Each individual in the group reaches a far higher level than he would have had he acted alone, no matter how hard he has worked. The Chofetz Chaim points out that we see this in bircas hamazon. When three people recite Grace after Meals together, they say \"let us bless,\" but when ten people recite it, they say, \"let us bless our God\" - they reach a higher level./\r\n\r\nWhen a community is actively involved in the pursuit of Torah and Mitzvos one should not separate himself from them since he is thereby preventing them from reaching higher levels and accomplishing greater things. The word \"TEAM\" stands for: Together, Everyone Accomplishes More!'),
(38, 33, 'All their countings were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty. (Num. 1:46)/\r\n\r\nA man passed away and left over a will for his children. The will stated that in a certain town on a particular street he had left 10 million dollars buried there. The sons immediately gathered up the necessary equipment and set out for that town. After much effort they found the exact street and began digging. They dug and labored for several hours but they turned up empty handed. They continued digging for several days and all they found was a few hundred dollars. Their backs were aching and their hands were sore but they did not give up; they kept on digging. They were sure that all the money was there; it was just a matter of time until they would find it./\r\n\r\nOne may think, \"Even if I toil and learn Torah sincerely I will never get anywhere. Studying Torah is just not my thing.\" But the truth is that there is a portion in the Torah that resonates with every person. It may be buried deep down but it\'s there. If you have not yet felt any connection with Torah it means that you haven\'t dug deep enough. You need to keep on digging! It is for this reason that this week\'s Torah portion is always read immediately prior to the holiday Shavuot. The portion mentions an accounting of the Jews to show us that each and every individual is significant and has a portion in Torah./\r\n\r\nEach person has their own way of thinking and their own way of looking at things. There are so many paths and so many angles in Torah that there isn\'t a single portion in Torah that a person can\'t have a natural love for. God created the Torah for us to connect with him, so there must be parts and places in there where that connection will happen.'),
(39, 34, 'The leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers\' household, brought offerings... (Num. 7:2)/\r\n\r\nThis week\'s Torah portion describes at length the offerings of the Nesi\'im (the leaders of the tribes) on the day that the Mishkan was inaugurated. Every Nasi offered the same offering. The Torah describes each Nasi\'s offering separately in virtually identical verses. Why could the Torah not simply mention the offerings the first time and then just say that the other Nesi\'im brought the exact same offerings?/\r\n\r\nA man was once on a speaking tour and prepared long and hard for his first speech. The speech was entertaining and engaging - a big success. The next night he was scheduled to speak in another town, and he planned on giving the same talk. He was about to begin speaking when he noticed that some of the people present had heard him lecture the night before! He couldn\'t possibly give the same speech, so he quickly put a couple of ideas together and came up with a new one. However, it didn\'t compare to the previous night. After the speech he approached the repeat customers and apologized for not giving them a well-prepared speech. Disappointed, they replied, \"You don\'t understand. We enjoyed last night so much that we came back to hear the same exact speech; we didn\'t want to hear a different one!\"/\r\n\r\nThe Torah is telling us that each Nasi who brought a sacrifice - even though it was identical to the previous Nasi\'s - in God\'s eyes it was like the first one he received. The sacrifice of every single Nasi was special to Him./\r\n\r\nSometimes we may feel that we are constantly doing the same exact thing over and over again, whether the prayers that we say day in day out or the mitzvos that we perform, and we may lose that initial enthusiasm. However, we must realize that every time we perform our duty God takes pleasure in it as if we had never done it before.'),
(40, 35, 'He (God) said, \"Please hear my words...\" (Num. 12:6)/\r\n\r\nMiriam and Aharon spoke lashon hara, derogatory speech, against Moshe. Although they had not acted with malice, in fact speaking more out of concern for Moshe\'s welfare, God\'s anger flared up and He rebuked them. However, when God addressed them He spoke in a very soft tone, starting: \"Please hear My words...\" The Sifsei Chachamim explains that even though God was angry at Miriam and Aharon, He still spoke to them in a soft tone, for if He would have spoken to them in a harsh and angry tone, His words would not have been heeded./\r\n\r\nWhen a person is spoken to harshly he feels under attack. His pride is at stake and he therefore does not fully hear what is being said. If God was careful in how He spoke to Miriam and Aharon who were prophets, then how much more so should we speak carefully to our spouses, colleagues or acquaintances. Even when one must confront an enemy, or admonish someone for a terrible misdeed, one should speak gently, for gentle words have a greater effect than words that are shouted and screamed. King Solomon teaches \"A soft answer turns away wrath.\" While one provocative remark can kindle anger, even the most intense fury can be soothed by a gentle word. Always remember: the louder the word the quieter it is heard.'),
(41, 36, 'And they shall place upon the tzitzis of each corner a thread of turquoise wool. (Num. 15:38)/\r\n\r\nThe weekly Torah portion concludes with the commandment of tzitzis, the commandment that helps one focus on his duties to God. As the Rabbis explain, the blue strand of wool reminds one of the ocean which is blue, which then reminds one of the sky, which is reminiscent of God\'s throne of glory. The question is why we need all these steps. We should put some resemblance of God on the tzitzis and go straight to the top. With all these steps we might never get to the top - we\'ll lose focus along the way!/\r\n\r\nAs a baby matures it goes through various stages: turning over, sitting up, crawling and finally walking. Many times, if the baby goes straight from the sitting stage to walking, they\'ll still teach it how to crawl. Any stage that it misses can greatly affect its capabilities later on in life. Every stage the baby goes through is necessary in developing another part of the brain./\r\n\r\nThe Torah is teaching us that the same concept exists in spirituality. Growth needs to be systematic. One needs to go through every stage, step by step, until he can get to the top. In every stage he develops skills which are needed to make him a complete person./\r\n\r\nQuite often one gets inspired and wants to become great overnight. In order for it to really last, a person needs to move at slow increments until each step becomes a part of him. For example, if he wants to improve his prayer and have stronger concentration, he needs to start with one small segment until he masters it, then moving on, as opposed to trying to master the whole thing at once. Growth is made up of lots of small steps, eventually leading to greatness.'),
(42, 37, 'Korach son of Izhar son of Kehas son of Levi took... (Num. 13:27)/\r\n\r\nKorach possessed many outstanding qualities. He hailed from a distinguished family, and was a wise man. How could he fall so low as to accuse Moshe of selfishly taking power and prestige for himself? The Torah testifies about Moshe, \"Now the man Moshe was exceedingly humble, more than any person on the face of the earth.\" How could Korach possibly accuse him of seeking honor!?/\r\n\r\nThere are two types of people. There are givers - people who are constantly looking for opportunities to assist others, and there are takers - people who are continuously looking to further add to their possessions, to satisfy their own needs and obtain more honor. The takers are never satisfied; they always desire more. At the very beginning of Korach\'s story the Torah reveals the root of his downfall: \"Korach took.\" -- Korach was a taker; he wanted more honor for himself. Even though he was already privileged to be in the tribe of Levi, that wasn\'t enough for him. He needed more. He wanted a prominent communal position and was jealous of the honor that Moshe and Aharon were getting. His jealousy knew no bounds and Korach did whatever he could to obtain that honor, even though it meant starting a rebellion./\r\n\r\nWhen someone is self-centered and has a particular desire, his intellect may get corrupted, preventing him from thinking rationally. Blinded by this desire, he will do anything. In order to avoid such a downfall he should work on assisting others and become a giver.'),
(43, 38, 'Speak to the rock before their eyes that it shall give its waters… Then Moshe raised his arm and struck the rock. (Num. 20:8,11)/\r\n\r\nMoshe was commanded to bring forth water from the rock by talking to it, but he erred and instead struck the rock twice until water poured forth. This sin caused Moshe to lose the privilege of entering the Land of Israel with the nation. Rashi explains that God had commanded Moshe to speak to the rock that had given them water before, but he could not find it. He spoke to a different rock, but nothing happened. He then proceeded to hit the rock which subsequently produced water./\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that Moshe listened to God and spoke to the rock - he just couldn\'t find it! Why was he then punished, being found at fault for not recognizing the rock?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah demands of us to recognize our benefactors and to appreciate them. The Egyptians had greatly harmed the Jewish people, but we are enjoined not to treat them similarly. The reason is because Egypt had provided food and lodging when Yaakov and his family resided there. That alone is enough for us to be thankful. The rock that had been providing the Jews with water for 40 years as they wandered in the desert should have been easily recognizable amongst the other rocks! Not recognizing that rock is considered a lack of appreciation and a grave sin./\r\n\r\nThe first thing a Jew starts his day with is gratitude: \"Modeh ani l\'fonecha...\"- \"I gratefully thank you, O living and eternal King, for You have returned my soul within me with compassion…\" Being grateful is the very fiber of a Jew. The Hebrew word for Jew is Yehudi which also means one who thanks. Gratitude helps one focus and take pleasure in what he has rather than concentrate on what he\'s lacking - which is the key to being a happy person.'),
(44, 39, 'The she-donkey said to Bilaam, \"Am I not your she-donkey that you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been accustomed to do such a thing to you?\" (Num. 22:30)/\r\n\r\nImagine you\'re on the way home from a wedding late at night. You\'ve been traveling many hours and you\'re wiped out. All you can think of is crawling into bed. You are nearing your house when suddenly you spot your neighbor\'s car blocking your driveway. You become enraged. \"How could he do something like that, he knows I need to park my car!!\" You circle the block for 10 minutes until you find parking, while thinking about how to retaliate against your neighbor./\r\n\r\nYou then remember that the Torah says to judge others favorably and give them the benefit of the doubt. But you think, \"How is it possible to give him the benefit of the doubt - he knows I need to park my car and nevertheless he blocked the driveway?!\"/\r\n\r\nBilam was riding his donkey on the way to curse the Jews when the donkey stopped moving, refusing to budge. Bilam struck it. The donkey, suddenly able to speak, asked in bewilderment, \"Hey, what was that for?!\" Bilam said, \"You\'re lucky I don\'t have my sword on me, otherwise I would have killed you!\"/\r\n\r\nThe donkey replied, \"Bilam, have I ever betrayed you? Have I been accustomed to do such a thing to you? Why in the world would you think that I\'m trying to hurt you and prevent you from going?!\"/\r\n\r\nThe donkey was telling Bilam to focus on the one doing the apparent \"evil\" and not to zoom in on the isolated incident. If the perpetrator is not accustomed to betraying you then it\'s more rational to assume that some far-out scenario must be taking place. In the case of the donkey, Bilam should have realized that there was something unusual going on. In fact there was an angel blocking the path which prevented the donkey from proceeding./\r\n\r\nThe same logic applies to your neighbor blocking the driveway. Since this action is not in character with your neighbor, it is more rational to assume that some emergency came up than to assume that he just did not care about you and prevented you from parking your car./\r\n\r\nBy giving people the benefit of the doubt, our lives, relationships and daily interactions will become more positive and successful - making the world a better place.'),
(45, 40, 'The name of the slain Israelite man who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, leader of a father\'s house Simeonites. (Num. 25:14)/\r\n\r\nAt the end of Parshas Balak the Torah relates that a Jew, in a shocking act of brazenness, brought a Midianite woman to Moshe and sinned with her in public view. Pinchas seized a spear and killed both the man and woman. In the beginning of Parshas Pinchas the Torah proceeds to reveal the identity of that man: Zimri the son of Salu. Why does the Torah wait until now to reveal to us who this man was?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person sees someone else sin, his sensitivities weaken and it is easier for him to sin as well. This is even more the case when the person who sins is regarded highly in society. Zimri held a high position; he was the leader of his tribe and one of the great people of the generation. Had the Torah mentioned at the time of the sin that the person sinning was Zimri, it would have had a tremendous negative influence on the people. People would reason, \"If such a great person can do something like that, then surely I can!\" Therefore the Torah waited until Pinchas killed him and demonstrated that such a sin is not tolerated no matter who you are. Now revealing the sinner would not have any harmful impact./\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates the magnitude a person\'s actions can have, affecting others positively or negatively. People watch what you do and follow suit. Even better than reproving others is to rectify one\'s own actions. If you have a big cup with a bunch of little cups surrounding it, there are two ways to fill up the cups. Either pour into each cup individually, or pour into the big cup, allowing it to overflow into all the small cups. When a person is overflowing with kindness, everyone around him becomes kinder./\r\n\r\nThe Chofetz Chaim used to say that in his younger years he wanted to perfect the world. That didn\'t work so he figured he would work to perfect Lithuania. That also didn\'t work so he decided that he would just perfect Radin, which again failed. He finally decided that he would just try to perfect himself. By perfecting himself he then influenced Radin, the whole of Lithuania and Jews worldwide!/\r\n\r\nIf other people\'s negative actions disturb you, you do not have to reprove them constantly. For example, if people come late to shul or are not sensitive with their speech, you can be extra careful in those areas and this will cause a change in them. Be the change that you want to see in the world!\r\n\r\n'),
(46, 41, 'Moshe was angry with the commanders of the army... (Num. 31:14)/\r\n\r\nThe laws of koshering utensils were transmitted by Elazar and not by Moshe because Moshe had become angry and forgot the laws. The difficulty with this is that Moshe was certainly justified in getting angry. God told the Jews to wage a war against Midian, who were responsible for causing the Jews to commit acts of immorality and idolatry. The troops killed all the males but spared the Midianite women - the ones who were primarily responsible for inciting those sins. Moshe thus became angry at the officers who allowed this. Why then was he punished?/\r\n\r\nImagine that you try to open your car door and the key won\'t turn. You begin to get frustrated and try to force the key to turn - jamming the key inside and causing considerable damage. If you had taken a step back and thought rationally, you would have realized that if the key is having difficulty turning then you must have stuck in the wrong key! When someone gets angry he turns off his intellect and acts on his instincts. He doesn\'t think rationally any more. Anger and intellect are a contradiction to each other./\r\n\r\nThe fact that the laws were not transmitted through Moshe was not a punishment. Rather, when Moshe became angry his instincts took over and his wisdom was removed from him. He could not remember the laws and so they had to be transmitted through Elazar./\r\n\r\nAnger can destroy years of investment in a relationship in a matter of minutes. It destroys one\'s health, eats away at happiness, and causes a person to lose his ability to think clearly. The trick is to hold yourself back at that initial instinctive reaction to retaliate; bite your tongue for just a few moments and then the anger will subside, enabling you to act rationally.'),
(47, 42, 'For the Children of Israel and the proselyte and resident among them shall these six cities be a refuge, for anyone who kills a person unintentionally to flee there. (Num. 35:15)/\r\n\r\nWhen someone takes a life unintentionally but with some degree of carelessness, the perpetrator is exiled to a city of refuge. He remains there until the death of the Kohen Gadol, the High Priest. Once the Kohen Gadol dies he is permitted to leave./\r\n\r\nThe Mishnah states that the mother of each Kohen Gadol used to hand out food to the murderers confined in the cities of refuge, in the hope of preventing them from praying for her son\'s speedy death. The question is: why would God listen to the prayers of a murderer and kill the Kohen Gadol - one of the leaders of the generation?!/\r\n\r\nThe power of prayer is not necessarily dependent on who you are but rather on your appreciation of who God is and your realization of Divine Providence. There is no one who has greater clarity in this than the man who killed unintentionally. He walks into the forest planning to chop wood and not intending to hurt anyone. He swings his axe. The axe head flies off the handle and kills an innocent bystander. He sees clearly how God has life and death completely in His hands. When he prays with such clarity in the knowledge that God is in control of everything, his prayer carries such an enormous weight that even the Kohen Gadol could die!/\r\n\r\nThe Maharsha writes that when a person prays sincerely, any benefit derived from prayer, no matter how extraordinary it appears, can be considered natural, since prayer has been an innate part of existence since the time of creation. When one prays with absolute clarity that everything is in God\'s hands, anything can happen...\r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(48, 43, 'I instructed your judges at that time, saying, \"Listen among your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother or his litigant.\" (Deut. 1:16)/\r\n\r\nMoshe instructed the judges to attempt to understand plaintiff\'s claims and to avoid haste in making judgments. He told them that even if they had seen a similar case two or three times in the past, they should still deliberate before issuing a ruling. The first mishnah in Pirkei Avos begins with this precaution: \"Be deliberate in judgment.\" Pirkei Avos teaches lessons for daily living. It consists of morals and ethics that the Sages wished to impart to their students. Why did they choose to begin with a lesson for judges, something that appears not to apply to everyone?/\r\n\r\nEvery driving manual opens with a caution to the driver to be aware that while driving he is constantly making decisions. He is constantly thinking, \"Should I brake now? Should I go through the yellow light? Do I have enough time to make this turn?\" If these choices are made in haste the results can be tragic./\r\n\r\nDaily living involves constant judgment and decision-making. When we meet people we immediately size them up. We are quick to judge people\'s actions. We make personal decisions. We decide where to live, how to lead life… The mishnah is telling us, \"Be deliberate in judgment.\" Every man is a judge. In all matters he should act with intent rather than in haste. Never jump into a decision which you may regret later on.'),
(49, 44, 'And you shall not covet your fellow\'s wife, you shall not desire your fellow\'s house... (Deut. 5:18)/\r\n\r\nWe understand why God commanded us not to steal or to kill; after all, it is physically possible for a person to refrain from performing such crimes. On the other hand, jealousy is an emotion and is an integral part of human nature; when you see something you like - you desire it. How can the Torah forbid something so natural as to desire someone else\'s possessions?/\r\n\r\nThe Ibn Ezra uses a profound insight into human nature to explain this prohibition. It is quite expected that an ignorant, poverty-stricken peasant might covet his neighbor\'s daughter, but it would never dawn on him to lust after the queen. She is so far away and inaccessible that such a thought would never enter his mind. Sensible, logical people only yearn for things within their frame of reference; they have no interest in things that are beyond their scope or their imagination. Similarly, man must perceive his neighbor\'s belongings as unattainable, like a golden ingot in Fort Knox./\r\n\r\nA storekeeper once complained to R\' Meir of Premishlan, \"Somebody opened a store right next to mine, and he is taking my business away!\" The sage replied, \"Have you ever seen a horse drink water from a river? He walks into the water and stamps his hooves. He sees another horse also drinking, he\'s envious and afraid that the \'other\' horse will drink up all the water, and therefore he kicks his own mirror image. That is the attitude of the horse, but you know better. Realize that there is enough water in the river for all the horses, and no one can touch what God has prepared for you. You have nothing to fear or be jealous of.\"'),
(50, 45, 'You shall love the proselyte for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. (Deut. 10:19)/\r\n\r\nAaron was very nervous. He had just moved to a new community and wasn\'t sure what it would be like. Would he fit in? Would the people be nice? He walked in to Shul nervous and tense; it was his first time attending. He looked around hoping someone would come over but no one said a word to him. He found an empty seat and sat down. A minute later a man walked over and tapped him on the shoulder. Aaron felt excited that finally someone would make him feel at home./\r\n\r\n\"I\'m sorry,\" the man said, \"but you\'re sitting in someone\'s seat. Please vacate it.\"/\r\n\r\nAaron stood up and remained in the aisle; feeling extremely uncomfortable.../\r\n\r\nAlthough converts are included in the commandment to love one\'s fellow Jew, the Torah nevertheless added an additional mitzvah to love the convert who is a stranger to his new environment. The Chinuch broadens this commandment to include all strangers, such as a newcomer to a neighborhood, a new student in a school, or a new employee./\r\n\r\nWhen someone is in a new situation he feels insecure and uncomfortable. Just doing a small thing such as approaching him with a warm smile and asking him his name may help him in a big way. \"Although to the world you may be just one person, but to one person you may just be the world!\"'),
(51, 46, 'See, I present before you today a blessing and a curse. (Deut. 11:26)/\r\n\r\nMoses informed the people about the blessings and curses that would be recited on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The verse begins with the word \"re\'eh\" - See, which is in the singular form. It then continues with \"lifneichem\" - before you, which is in the plural form. What is the reason for this change?/\r\n\r\nWhen a person finds himself in an inconvenient situation, he may become distressed and upset that such a \"curse\" has happened to him. For example, if one gets stuck in traffic he may miss his flight, and as a result he may lose out on a big business deal. But the truth is that it can actually turn out to be a blessing. It is possible that the loss of money is meant as an atonement for past sins, as well as preventing worse catastrophes from occuring. The Torah is alluding to this message by putting \"See\" in the singular form, for there is really only \"One\" that knows if something is a blessing or a curse - God./\r\n\r\nA man once asked King Solomon to teach him the language of the birds. King Solomon refused, explaining that it was not a good idea to be familiar with it. The man persisted, so King Solomon taught it to him./\r\n\r\nOne day the man was walking down the street and listened to the birds chirping. They were talking about him, saying that tonight all his sheep were going to die! He thought to himself, \"This is horrible news, but at least I can sell them before that happens.\" Indeed he sold his sheep./\r\n\r\nA few days later he listened to the birds chirping, and again they were talking about him, saying his house was going to burn down. He quickly sold it, thinking to himself, \"It\'s a good thing that I know bird language! I am saving myself so much money!\"/\r\n\r\nThe next day he heard the birds saying that tonight he would die! He ran to King Solomon and told him what had happened. King Solomon replied, \"Now you\'ll understand why I didn\'t want you to know the language of the birds. You did a certain sin for which you deserved a severe punishment, but God, in His great kindness, wanted to give you a clean slate by giving you a small punishment - killing all your sheep. However, you didn\'t allow Him to do that, so He moved on to your house. You still did not allow Him do so, and therefore the only thing that God could give you to provide you with atonement was your death.\"/\r\n\r\nWhen troubles befall a person he should attempt to accept it with joy, for who knows what tragedies it is saving him from.'),
(52, 47, 'Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue. (Deut. 16:20)/\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the parsha the Torah tells us, \"Righteousness, righteousness shall you pursue.\" The second \"righteousness\" seems superfluous. What is it coming to teaching us?/\r\n\r\nSometimes a person wants to do God\'s will but he gets so caught up in fulfilling the commandments that he overlooks different areas. For example, he might want to rise very early in the morning to pray, but his alarm then awakens everyone else in his family./\r\n\r\nReb Bunim of Peshis\'cha interprets the verse in this vein: pursue righteousness righteously. It is not enough to seek righteousness; it must be done through honest means. The Torah does not condone the pursuit of holiness through improper means. One has to make sure that he is not stepping on anyone else\'s toes when performing the commandments./\r\n\r\nThe Chozeh of Lublin wanted to arise very early one morning to take care of a great mitzvah. The night before he asked his wife to prepare supper extra early so that he would be able to wake up in time. That night, not only was supper not served early - it was served even later than usual. Consequently he did not wake up in time and did not perform that great mitzvah. He thought to himself, \"I would be justified in getting angry at my wife. However, why should I get angry because my wife prevented me from serving God? It\'s God\'s will for me not to get angry!\"'),
(53, 48, 'If a man will have a wayward and rebellious son... (Deut. 21:18)/\r\n\r\nThe \"Rebellious son\" is one who repeatedly steals money to purchase meat and wine and consumes it in a disgusting manner. He is brought to Bais Din, the Jewish Court and is subject to capital punishment. According to one opinion in the Gemara the case of the \"rebellious son\" never happened and never will happen, since in practice the detailed requirements derived from the verses are never fulfilled. If so, why did God find it necessary to place this portion in the Torah?/\r\n\r\nThe death penalty imposed on the rebellious son is not because of the gravity of his sins, but because his behavior demonstrates that he will degenerate into a monstrous human being for whom there is no hope. The Torah is teaching us that a person for whom there is no hope will never exist. If you were created, and you exist, then you can become great!/\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we may fall and convince ourselves that we are failures. If we try something a few times and it doesn\'t go, we then believe that we can\'t be successful. But the truth is the exact opposite. King Solomon wrote, \"A righteous person falls seven times, yet rises again.\" (Mishlei 24:16) The uninformed assume the meaning to be that greatness can be achieved despite experiencing an occasional stumble; however, the wise know that the verse\'s intention is to instruct us that the very path to greatness is solely attained by stumbling and then rising. Stumbling is not a sign of failure but rather an opportunity for greatness. Each time you fall know that you\'re one step closer to becoming great!/\r\n\r\nThomas Edison, considered the greatest inventor of his time, was responsible for over 1,000 different patents, and some refinements of previous inventions. Edison failed to refine the light bulb (one of the few things he merely refined but did not invent) so many times that it took him 10,000 attempts to perfect it! However, rather than accepting failure 9,999 times he is quoted as saying, \"I have not failed. I have just found 9,999 ways that do not work.\" In his mind failure was simply another stepping stone on the road to success.'),
(54, 49, 'And you shall take of the first of every fruit of the ground... (Deut. 26:2)/\r\n\r\nThe Parsha begins with the commandment of Bikkurim, the first fruits. The farmer is to take his first ripened fruits to the temple and present them to the Cohen. The Midrash teaches that it was in the merit of the bringing of the first fruits that the world was created. What is so significant about this mitzvah?/\r\n\r\nMan was placed in the world with the mission of recognizing his Creator. The problem is that we are consumed with manipulating and changing the world. We\'re busy conquering space, closing deals, creating products, erecting buildings and traveling the information super-highway. It comes to a point that we begin thinking not only that we are God-like in that we have a creative force in the world, but that we are actually God, complete masters of the universe./\r\n\r\nThe purpose of bikkurim is to make sure we don\'t misunderstand our place in the universe. A person spends many months plowing, planting and caring for his field. After much hard work and sweat the first fruits are beginning to ripen! He\'s excited to taste the fruits which he himself nurtured and developed. Yet, recognizing that the whole process was really God\'s doing, he takes those very first ripe fruits and brings it to the Temple. Man merely goes through the motions, but God actually creates./\r\n\r\nOnce we recognize that we\'re not the Creator and everything we have is a gift from God only then do we have the ability to form a relationship with Him.'),
(55, 50, 'And you shall choose life, so that you will live, you and your offspring. (Deut. 30:19)/\r\n\r\nThe Torah stresses that choosing life is not only for the benefit of the one making the choice, but also for the benefit of his offspring so that they will live. How does your decision to want life help your children? Don\'t they have to choose life as well?/\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a person to learn Torah and do mitzvos, and yet these actions won\'t have any positive effect on his children. If one does mitzvot because he believes in God and knows that he has to do it, but does so half-heartedly, or with the attitude that they are a heavy burden, his children may well choose not to follow his path of Torah and mitzvot. For example, after spending $100 on an etrog he says, \"Oiy, s\' iz shver tzoo zaiyn a yid\" (it is hard to be a Jew). Naturally, his children will be reluctant to follow the Torah. They\'ll reason, \"Our father is doing all this because he has to. We are not as strong as him and it is just too hard for us to keep the Torah.\"/\r\n\r\nHowever, if one does mitzvot with joy and pride, making it clear that this is what gives him life and energizes him, then they will want to experience the same enjoyment in life that their father experienced. Therefore the Torah tells us, \"You shall choose life in a way that will inspire your children to choose it and live.\"'),
(56, 51, 'So now, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel… (31:19)/\r\n\r\nOur Sages derive from this verse that each person is required to write a Sefer Torah, a Torah scroll for himself. Even if one inherited a Sefer Torah or received one as a gift, he is nevertheless still obligated to write one. Why is it so important for each individual to write his own Sefer Torah?/\r\n\r\nA person who starts a business will put his whole heart and soul into it. He will stay up late at night and spend lots of money to make sure everything runs smoothly. If anyone makes a negative remark about his company, he will be the first one to stick up for it. For some reason he never gets sick and doesn’t need to take off. When he retires and passes the reigns over to his son, things just won’t be the same. His son will definitely do his job and may even work overtime, but he won’t put his whole heart and soul into it like his father did. After all, it’s not his own business. There is no comparison between an employee and the founder of a company./\r\n\r\nA person is obligated to write his own Sefer Torah because Hashem wants a person to feel the Torah is his own, and not a hand-me-down. Each individual is meant to become a CEO over the Torah, going to great lengths to make sure he fulfills the Torah, and spending the time and effort to ensure that his “business” is running smoothly.'),
(57, 52, 'The Rock! – perfect is His work, for all His paths are justice; a God of faith without iniquity, righteous and fair is He. (32:4)/\r\n\r\nFew people need to be convinced that God created the world. However, situations may occur that are difficult to comprehend and leave even believers with many questions. There is a higher level of belief in God: not only did He create the world, but He is intimately involved in its day-to-day running. Hashem presses all the buttons and causes all events to occur, right down to the last detail./\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that the Torah put the first commandment in the context of the exodus: “I am your God who has taken you out of the land of Egypt.” Even though it would have been logical for God to identify himself as the Creator of the universe, a more all-inclusive title than that of engineer of the exodus, God was teaching us that He is also deeply involved in our everyday lives, intervening to pluck us out of Egypt./\r\n\r\nA guest in a village did not understand why the more important members of the shul sat at the back, while the beggars and paupers sat at the front. When he questioned the shul president about it he was told, “You are confused because you are here for only one Shabbos. If you would be here every Shabbos you would understand that we have a procedure of alternating places which, over the course of a year, is fair to everybody.” The Chofetz Chaim uses this parable to demonstrate that our questions and doubts over God’s supervision of the world are due to our lack of understanding. God’s management of this world is based on considerations of a 6,000 year time period. We are in this world for a sum total of 70, 80, or maybe 90 years. How can we expect to know the answers when we are missing parts of the puzzle?');

(33:16)/\r\n\r\nMoshe blessed each tribe according to its individual greatness and national responsibilities. When blessing Yoseph, he mentioned, “…he who was separated from his brothers.” What special praise is there in the fact that Yoseph was separated from his brothers?/\r\n\r\nUsually, a person’s values are based upon those of the society that he grew up in. One naturally becomes like those in his environment. There was no better place to be brought up than in the house of Yaakov. Anyone brought up in such an environment was likely to become a great person – just look at Yoseph’s eleven brothers! However, Yoseph was sent to Egypt, a place filled with immorality and idol worship, at a very young age, and did not have the luxury of growing up in a kosher environment. Nevertheless, against all odds, he remained strong and became the tzaddik that he was!/\r\n\r\nA bunch of guys were sitting down together, talking and eating. Everyone looked pretty much the same and they were all basically doing the same thing. One by one they got up to leave, except for one of them who just stayed in his seat, not moving. While they were trying to figure out why he was just sitting there, they noticed that he had no feet – that’s why he couldn’t move!!/\r\n\r\nWhen they were sitting down they had all looked the same. It was only when it became time for each one to get up and go off in his own direction that each of their individual strengths and weaknesses became apparent. Only when one is outside of his comfort zone can we truly see a person’s strengths.');
