(1, 0, 'In the beginning of God\'s creating the heavens and the earth... God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work which God created to make\r\n\r\nThese two verses encompass all of Creation. The opening three words end in the letters taf, aleph, mem, which spell emet – truth, and the closing three words end in aleph, mem, taf, which again spell emet. Rabbi Simchah Bunim of P\'shis\'che cites the Talmudic statement, “The seal of God is emet”, and comments, “It is customary for an author to place his name in the opening of his book. God placed His Name emet – truth, in the opening chapter of the Torah. Emet thus envelops all of creation, a testimony to God as the Creator.”\r\n\r\nDivrei Shaul notes that all traits can be a matter of degree. There can be greater beauty and lesser beauty, greater wisdom and lesser wisdom, greater strength and lesser strength, etc. Only one trait cannot be more or less: truth. There is no such thing as greater truth and lesser truth. Something is either true or is not true.\r\n\r\nGod is identified with truth. Just as truth can never be altered, because altered truth is no longer true, there can be no change in God. (Malachi,2:6).\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that emet is broad-based, consisting of the first letter of the alphabet, aleph, the middle letter, mem, and the last letter, taf (Shabbos 55a). Truth, therefore, has stability and durability. Falsehood, on the other hand, is the Hebrew sheker, consisting of three letters near the end of the alphabet. Sheker is top-heavy and cannot endure.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that a person lives with truth is the extent one identifies with God. Any falsehood distances a person from God.'),
(2, 1, 'While perhaps our motivation for being giving people should be because it is a religious imperative or because it is just the right thing to do, there is an added benefit as it seems to lead to increased mental health and life expectancy. Some studies link being a caregiver, whether for a family member or for others, with living longer. Others indicate that people who consistently volunteer outlive those that don’t. There are even studies that link owning and taking care of pets with a longer life span.\r\n\r\nWhen Noah is commanded to gather the animals there are two seemingly contradictory instructions. On the one hand, he is told that he should bring the animals to the ark (“tavi el hateiva – you shall bring to the ark”), and on the other, he is told that the animals will come to him (“yavo-u eilecha – shall come to you”) (6:19-20).\r\n\r\nRabbeinu Bechaye clarifies that the intent is that Noah will not have to go and seek out the animals from their natural habitats as the animals will all approach Noah. Once they arrived near the ark, Noah was tasked to bring them inside. Yet, we are left wondering, if God would provide a miracle that ensured that the animals all came to Noah, why make him responsible for bringing them into the ark? Why not just finish the miracle and have the animals board the ark on their own?\r\n\r\nRabbi Moshe Alshich provides a powerful explanation. If viewed from a perspective of strict judgment (“din”), Noah did not merit being saved either. The only way he would survive is if God dealt with him with mercy (“rachamim”). Yet, in order to earn God’s mercy, Noah needed to demonstrate his own acts of mercy. He needed to commit acts of kindness and generosity in order to warrant being saved. God could have just brought the animals into the ark, but it was imperative that Noah be afforded the opportunity to interact with the animals and demonstrate his ability to be compassionate. Therefore, the animals were just brought to Noah, but he needed to physically escort them into the ark.\r\n\r\nThe stated purpose in the sentences of this whole enterprise is in order “lehachyot” – to make live. The verb is intransitive, meaning that it does not explicitly state who is made to live through Noah’s actions. Radak explains that it is referring to the animals. Noah was responsible for the physical health of the animals and needed to provide food for them daily in order that they live. Alshich, building off his thesis that Noah needed to exhibit his ability to act mercifully in order to survive, explains that “lehachyot – to make live” can also be referring to Noah. By becoming the caretaker of the animals, Noah himself would be granted a longer life.\r\n\r\nIn a world flooded with verbal violence and hostility, we would do well to learn a lesson from Noah. Let us act with compassion, mercy, and generosity to all beings. By doing so, may we merit God’s mercy and be granted long, happy, and healthy lives.'),
(3, 2, 'And he trusted in God, and God reckoned (it to him as righteousness 15:6)\r\n\r\nThe Torah tells us that God considered the patriarch Abraham’s faith to be meritorious. But let us reflect a moment. If God spoke to any of us, would we not have an unshakeable faith? In what way is Abraham praiseworthy for believing in God with Whom he communicated directly?\r\n\r\nThis question is also asked about Moses. How could Moses fulfill the mitzvah of having faith in God when he was in direct contact with him? We do not have faith that there is a moon or that two plus two equals four. That which we see or understand does not require an act of faith.\r\n\r\nThe answer was given by Rabbi Mordechai of Lechovitz, who cited the Talmud that at the end of a person’s life when he stands before God, he will be asked, “Did you transact in faith?” (Shabbos 31a). This is usually understood as asking whether one transacted business honestly. Rabbi Mordechai said that it has an additional meaning. When a person transacts in business, he negotiates and tries in every way to maximize his profit. He does not settle for a meager gain. his is what one will be asked at the end of his life: “Did you transact in faith?” i.e., did you do everything possible to maximize your faith, or did you just accept whatever you were given?\r\n\r\nAbraham and Moses transacted in faith. They, of course, knew there was a God. They did not have to have faith in His existence. But they tried to strengthen their faith by coming to an ever greater knowledge of God and believing even that which they could not see about God.\r\n\r\nSome people take their faith in God for granted. Of course, they believe that there is a God. But they may not have gone beyond that to try to know more and more about God. We have great works available to us to increase our faith and broaden our concept of God. If we fail to do so, we will have no answer when we are asked, “Did you seek to improve the quality of your faith? Did you transact in faith?”'),
(4, 3, 'He (Lot) said, “Behold now, my lords; turn about please, to your servant’s house; spend the night and wash your feet, then wake up early and go your way…” He made a feast for them and baked matzos, and they ate (19:2-3).\r\n\r\nMany books have been written about parenting. There is universal agreement that the single greatest influence on children is their parents’ behavior. All other techniques parents may employ are not nearly as effective as what they themselves do. Parental behavior is deeply ingrained in children.\r\n\r\nThe Torah teaches us this in the character of Lot. Lot was a rogue who rejected Abraham, saying, “I want neither Abram nor his God” (Rashi, Genesis 13:11). Lot chose to live in the corrupt city of Sodom, fully aware of their decadence (ibid 13:13). He married a woman of Sodom, who turned into a pillar of salt as punishment because when Lot asked her to give his guests salt, she said, ”Are you trying to bring this wicked trait of hospitality to us?” (Midrash). According to the Midrash, giving food and shelter to wayfarers was punishable by death in Sodom.\r\n\r\nYet this depraved scoundrel, Lot, risked his life to take in guests and indeed aroused the entire populace against him. He put himself in even greater danger when he defied the populace and sought to protect his guests. This seems to be incongruous with his degenerate character.\r\n\r\nR’ Meir Rubman (Zichron Meir) says that having been exposed to his Uncle Abraham in his youth and having witnessed the overwhelming dedication which Abraham had to hachnasas orchim, welcoming guests, made an indelible impression on Lot. There is every reason to believe that Lot assimilated to his environment, and indeed, he was spared from the destruction of Sodom solely because he was Abraham’s nephew (Rashi, Genesis 19:17). In spite of his depravity, he could not extirpate this particular trait, to the point of risking his life to be hospitable to guests.\r\n\r\nThis is a convincing example of the power of early imprinting. It is commonplace that children who were victims of parental abuse may swear that they will never be harsh to their children, yet they often repeat the very abuse they despised. This may seem to defy logic. However, the early imprinting of behavior may overwhelm logic. There is only one effective method to teach children proper behavior, and that is for parents to practice it themselves.'),
(5, 4, 'I have given you the field, and as for the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; in the view of the children of my people have I given it to you. (Gen. 23:11,15)\r\n\r\nAvraham set out to buy the Cave of Machpela and the field surrounding it from Efron Hachiti. Efron said to Avraham \"Don\'t bother paying for it. I\'ll give you both the field and the cave as a gift!\" Shortly after, Efron changed his mind and set the price at 400 silver shekels. What happened?! Why did he suddenly change from being overly generous to being a greedy man?\r\n\r\nMany years ago the Rambam had a debate with philosophers. The philosophers claimed that a cat\'s nature could be altered to be like that of a human being. The Rambam said, \"An animal will always remain an animal.\" The philosophers went about proving their theory. They took a cat and spent weeks training it, and were finally ready to present their case. Everyone gathered to see what would happen. In walked a cat dressed as a waiter, carrying a tray with wine and glasses. Everyone was amazed. The Rambam, on the other side of the room, took a bag out of his pocket, opened it, and a mouse came out. The cat saw it, dropped the tray, and dashed across the room to catch the mouse! Everyone then agreed with the Rambam; you can definitely train a cat, but you can\'t change a cat\'s nature.\r\n\r\nEfron was the same. When Avraham asked him for the cave, they were in front of all the B\'nei Cheis. Therefore Efron said that it was free, thinking, \"Why not let everyone think that I am a nice guy?\" When Avraham wanted to pay for it and was holding a wad of bills, Efron saw the money and forgot about everything he had said. He just wanted the cash, so he charged Avraham an enormous amount.\r\n\r\nSome people appear very pleasant and friendly, but if someone steps on their toe or spills something on them they go berserk. These people never truly changed their nature. When things are calm and going their way they are able to act nicely, but inside they are capable of exploding at the slightest infraction. By contrast, a person who truly changes his nature - through self-introspection, examination, and work - will be in total control of his attitude in every single situation. He won\'t be affected by external circumstances.'),
(6, 5, 'Murray Bowen was one of the pioneers of the field of family therapy. He noted that families have a system of psychological interconnectedness. For instance, when one member of a family becomes anxious, this tends to have an emotional snowball effect on the other members of the family. For psychological health and wellness, it is important for individuals within families not to become too fused with the thoughts, emotions, and actions of other members of their family. Rather, the ideal is differentiation of the self, where each individual is able to experience and balance both intimacy with, and independence from, others in the family.\r\n\r\nAs Rabbi Jonathan Sacks highlighted in his essay, “On Clones and Identity,” Yitzchak was the least individuated of the patriarchs. There isn’t much we know about his life, but what we do know seems to parallel and repeat many of the events and actions of Avraham. They both have to leave their land and enter the land of the Plishtim because of a famine. They both tell Avimelech that their wives are their sisters. To accentuate the parallel, the Torah tells us that Yitzchak even re-digs the same exact wells that Avraham dug, and even gives them the same exact names that his father gave them! There seems to be a lack of differentiation of self on Yitzchak’s part.\r\n\r\nApparently, there was insufficient water from Avraham’s wells that Yitzchak re-dug, so Yitzchak moved towards individuation and initiative by digging a new well. Yet, the Torah tells us that his first attempt was fraught with difficulty. The people of Gerar claimed that the water from the well belonged to them, which led to an argument. Consequently, Yitzchak named that well “Esek” (dispute) because of the fight that transpired. Yitzchak’s second attempt to dig a well was just as unsuccessful. It also led to controversy with the people of Gerar, so he called it “Sitnah” (hatred) because of the hatred and enmity it engendered. Finally, Yitzchak’s third attempt to dig was successful as it was devoid of dispute. Yitzchak calls this well “Rechovot, (expanse)” which connotes peace, freedom, and space. Yitzchak is able to create a location for himself by differentiating from the Plishtim as well as carving out his own personal place in his family narrative./\r\n\r\nWhat is unclear, however, is why the third attempt was successful, while the first two were not. The Chafetz Chaim suggests that the Torah is teaching us a lesson in grit and perseverance: if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again. Rabbi Norman Lamm suggests another approach in the name of his uncle, Rabbi Joseph Baumol. If we pay careful attention, there is a fundamental textual difference between the first two diggings and the third. For the first two, the verses highlight that it was Yitzchak’s servants who dug the wells. Yet, for the third well it says that Yitzchak – not his servants – dug the third well./\r\n\r\nWhile there is a place for delegation, there are actions in life that must be performed by the individual if they are to be successful. While Avraham served as an important role-model for Yitzchak, it was time for Yitzchak to begin to differentiate and forge his own path. This journey could not be proxied out to others. It was something Yitzchak needed to experience himself. He needed to dig the new well, not his servants. Once he took responsibility and acted on his own accord, he was able to merit the “Rechovot” – the space to flourish and grow on his own.'),
(7, 6, 'He (Jacob) said, “Look, the day is still long; it is not yet time to bring the livestock in; water the flock and go on grazing” (Genesis, 29:7)./\r\n\r\nJacob was rather harsh in reprimanding the shepherds. Wasn\'t it obvious that the stone covering the well was so massive that it required many men to move it? The Rabbi of Gur (Imrei Emes) said that Jacob was aware of this, but that he rebuked them for not trying to move it. But is it not possible that they had in fact tried but could not move it? Yes, but just because they failed once, why were they not trying again? But how did Jacob know that they had not tried repeatedly? Was his rebuke justified?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch sheds light on this episode by asking, why was it necessary to cover the well with so massive a stone? Could they not have covered it with something not quite as heavy? He answers that the shepherds were suspicious of one another, and feared that a lighter cover would enable one of them to uncover the well on his own and take an unfair share of the water for his flock. In order to prevent this, they made it impossible to have access to the water unless they were all present.\r\n\r\nJacob understood this, and reasoned that people who had no trust in one another were likely to be indolent and not exert themselves. Traits are infectious. Trust and diligence are likely to go hand in hand, as are distrust and sloth. Jacob knew that they had not even tried to uncover the well./\r\n\r\nEven in a competitive world, we should have faith that what God decreed for us to have cannot be taken from us. Begrudging other people\'s success because we may think that it comes at our expense is a contemptible character trait, and unless we rid ourselves of this trait, it may affect other aspects of our character./\r\n\r\nCharacter traits are not likely to exist in isolation. True faith in God and to fargin others (be happy for someone else\'s good fortune) tend to go together./\r\n\r\nSo Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him a few days because of his love for her (29:20)/\r\n\r\nSome of the commentaries note that this appears to be the reverse of what we usually experience. Being separated from someone one loves makes each day of separation feel like an eternity. How could it be that Jacob\'s love for Rachel made seven years seem like but a few days?/\r\n\r\nI am indebted to one of my patients for an insight into this verse. This young man was recovering from an addiction to alcohol. He had become dependent on alcohol, and the thought that he could never drink again was intolerable. When he joined the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, he was told not to focus on the rest of his life, but to deal with just this day. “It is not impossible for you to abstain from drinking just today, is it? Then focus only on what you must do today. There is nothing you can do today about tomorrow\'s sobriety, so there is no point in contemplating it.”/\r\n\r\nI have found this principle in the works of mussar. The yetzer hara (evil inclination) says, “What point is there in trying to observe all the Torah prohibitions? There is no way you can do so for the rest of your life. You are certain to violate Torah in quest of your desires. Why fight a losing battle? Why struggle and deny yourself so many pleasures when you are doomed to fail at it? You might as well just give in now.” The response to the yetzer hara should be, “I do not have to deal with the rest of my life today. I know that today I can withstand temptation, and that is all I am concerned with. When tomorrow comes, I\'ll deal with that challenge then.”/\r\n\r\nThe literal translation of the verse above is not “they seemed to him a few days.” The Hebrew word achadim means “single days.” The delay of seven years would have been very difficult to manage. Jacob, therefore, did not think of seven years, but took each day as it came. He could tolerate the deprivation today, and that was all that was necessary./\r\n\r\nThis is an important lesson for us. It is commonplace for people to make “New Year\'s resolutions,” and these are soon broken. The reason for this is that a year is too great a task to undertake. One should resolve, “I will not lose my temper today,” or “I will not smoke today” or “I will adhere to my diet today.” Reducing challenges to smaller segments of time makes them much more manageable.'),
(8, 7, 'Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn (32:25)/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that the person who attacked Jacob was the guardian angel of Esau. The commentaries add that this angel represents the yetzer hara, the prime spiritual force of evil that wished to vanquish Jacob and his descendants./\r\n\r\nThe rabbi of Slonim interprets this verse to provide us with an important lesson. He points out that the Hebrew word vayivoser – was left – can also mean “to be superfluous,” and the message of the verse is that Jacob felt that he was superfluous when he was alone, isolated and detached from others.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist says, “For I have said that the world is built upon chesed (loving-kindness).” The Chassidic writings interpret this verse as a reason for Creation. Although we cannot have any concept into the essence of the Divine attributes, we are told that God created the world because “it is in the nature of the good to do good” and without a world, there would be no recipients for God\'s goodness./\r\n\r\nWe are supposed to emulate the Divine attributes, and the foremost obligation of man is to do chesed. But chesed cannot be done in a vacuum. The phrase, “God said `It is not good that man be alone,\' ” (Genesis 2:18) means not only that a person should not be without a spouse, but also that “there can be no goodness when man is alone.” Goodness requires that there be a relationship, a recipient of one\'s chesed. Inasmuch as the purpose of creation was for man to emulate God in doing chesed, failure or the inability to do chesed leaves a person unfulfilled./\r\nIn my writings on self-esteem (Angels Don\'t Leave Footprints) I pointed out that we value things for one of two reasons: (1) they are functional or (2) they are ornamental. If you have a grandfather clock whose mechanism breaks down, you may keep it as a handsome piece of furniture. If your can-opener no longer works, you discard it. Since it has no esthetic component, it has no value if it is not functional./\r\n\r\nOn what basis can a person have a sense of self-worth? Few people are so handsome as to be ornamental, and even those who are exceptionally handsome lose their beauty as they grow old. Man\'s true worth is in his function, and inasmuch as a major function of man is to do chesed, the inability or failure to do chesed deprives a person of a source of self-esteem.\r\n\r\nOne of the tactics of the yetzer hara is to crush a person by depriving him of the ability to do chesed. The person who is isolated from others and cannot give of himself to others may lose his sense of self-worth. My years of working with people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol has convinced me that one of the factors that lead to addiction is self-centeredness. One recovered alcoholic expressed it this way: “I could look up at people or I could look down my nose at them. They were either far above me or beneath me, but I never felt that I belonged. Alcohol gave me the feeling that I belonged.” This person escaped from the distress of isolation via the anesthetic effects of alcohol./\r\n\r\nFeeling that one does not belong causes a person to feel superfluous. The rabbi of Slonim found this message in the verse which he translated as, “Jacob felt superfluous because he was alone.” The low self-esteem and depression incident to isolation renders a person vulnerable to the attack of the yetzer hara./\r\n\r\nDoing chesed is not only a great mitzvah, but it also helps a person to have a sense of worthiness and self-esteem.'),
(12, 8, 'When Yosef’s brothers decide they are going to kill him and throw him into a pit, Reuven realizes that he needs to intervene to save Yosef’s life. While Reuven’s explicit intention is to return Yosef to Yaakov, he is caught in a predicament. What can he say or do that will convince the brothers not to kill Yosef? Their decision seems unanimous and definitive./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash states that if Reuven would have known that his decision would be recorded for history, he would have picked Yosef up on his shoulders and escorted him back to his father. But is this realistic? Would the brothers have allowed Reuven to just walk away with Yosef after they have condemned him to death?/\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Cialdini is known for his research on influence and persuasion. He spent three years as an “undercover” researcher training at used car dealerships, telemarketing firms, and fund-raising organizations in order to observe, analyze, and categorize principles of effective persuasion. If we analyze how Reuven influenced and persuaded his brothers in this crucial moment, we will uncover several strategies that Dr. Cialdini outlines in his research./\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his bestselling book “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,” Dr. Cialdini writes that the first and foremost principle of persuasion is tapping into the other person’s self-interest by convincing others that their decision will turn out best for them. It is so fundamental and obvious, he writes, that he doesn’t even count it as one of his six principles of influence./\r\n\r\nThis, Rabbeinu Bechaye argues, is Reuven’s strategy in convincing his brothers not to kill Yosef. He doesn’t just say “let’s not hit him” because that would leave open the possibility that Reuven was motivated by his own feelings of empathy and self-interest. Rather, he adds the word “nefesh – soul,” in order to emphasize that the goal is to avoid killing Yosef for the brothers’ own sake: in order that they don’t become murderers./\r\n\r\nAnother powerful category of influence is when the influencer convinces others that they are alike by identifying socially as a group with similar interests. Rabbi Yosef Bechor Shor identifies this strategy within Reuven’s word-choice. Reuven doesn’t speak at them saying “don’t hit him,” rather, he purposefully includes himself in the group with the intention of increasing his influence by saying, “let us not hit him.” Rabbeinu Bechaye suggests this strategy is also apparent in another strategic word-choice. Instead of saying “don’t spill his blood,” he just says, “don’t spill blood.” This subtle tactic indicates to the brothers that Reuven identifies with their hatred of Yosef and he is not concerned about Yosef’s blood per se. Rather, the argument is not to spill any blood for the sake of not becoming murderers./\r\n\r\nDr. Cialdini writes that there is a single word that will dramatically boost the power of influence: because. In one study by Dr. Ellen Langer, when people making copies at a photocopy machine were asked by a stranger “Excuse me, I have 5 pages, may I use the Xerox machine?” 60 percent of the people complied. When the stranger added “because I am in a rush,” 94 percent complied. Even more fascinating, when the stranger just added the obvious explanation of “because I have to make copies,” there was still a 93 percent compliance rate. Just by adding a reason, influence is increased./\r\n\r\nAbarbanel sees this strategy in Reuven’s argument as well. At first, all Reuven says is “let’s not kill him” (37:21). Apparently, the brothers were not convinced yet, so Reuven adds in the next verse, “let’s not spill his blood, let’s throw him into a pit” (37:22). Abarbanel explains that after the brothers didn’t respond to his general statement of “let’s not kill him, Reuven now provides the “because.” Let’s not kill him because it is terrible to spill innocent blood directly./\r\n\r\nBy analyzing the verses in depth, we get a glimpse into the genius of Reuven’s strategy to stop his brothers from committing murder. By using the subtle persuasion techniques of self-interest, group identification, and providing an explanation, he is able to diffuse a threatening situation and save Yosef’s life.'),
(13, 9, 'How much do you care about what other people think of you?/\r\n\r\nOn one level, it is natural and healthy to want the approval of others. If someone doesn’t care at all what others think of him, he may do things that are harmful or immoral to others and end up being isolated from social groups, which itself is not healthy. Yet, the desire to be liked by others can easily become unhealthy. People who have a high need to gain approval from others determinedly seek admiration, sometimes at a high cost to their own goals. They tend to have higher anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem (that is contingent on how they think other people think of them)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud (Berachot 20a) relates that Yosef and his descendants are immune from the destructive power of the evil eye. Before we understand why they are immune, first we need to better understand this mysterious and controversial concept. Broadly speaking, as it is presented in the Talmud, when Person A looks upon Person B (or their material goods) with envy or jealousy, that act of looking can cause actual damage to Person B./\r\n\r\nThere have been several explanations of this concept throughout the ages, including (subsequently disproven) scientific explanations of the ability for the eye to emit a dangerous vapor or fire, and a theological proposal that the negative emotions provoke God to be extra meticulous towards Person B (which has its own set of controversial ramifications). Those who view the evil eye as a supernatural phenomenon either try not to draw too much attention to themselves or use various mystical procedures to try and counteract it./\r\n\r\nOthers, however, provide a more rationalist, psychological explanation of the concept. Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak HaKohen Kook, for instance, understands the evil eye as general social influence. We can be easily swayed by other people’s beliefs, opinions and practices, and ayin hara (evil eye) is the term used to indicate being negatively impacted by others (see Ein Ayah on Berachot, p. 102). Someone who has self-confidence and is sure that they are doing what is right in the eyes of God won’t be swayed by the negative influence of others, and is therefore immune to the evil eye./\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik assumes that ayin hara is representative of the negative social dynamics between two people. When Person A disagrees, criticizes, or opposes Person B, Person A is putting an ayin hara on Person B. If Person B’s sense of self is too intertwined with what other people think of him, then when Person A does anything to indicate that he doesn’t approve of Person B, Person B will be devastated. However, if Person B has a developed sense of self that is independent and does not desperately need the approval of others, then he would be immune to the ayin hara of others./\r\n\r\nTaking a similar rational approach, Rabbi Immanuel Bernstein argues that the reason Yosef was immune to the evil eye was because he was self-confident and not swayed by the opinions or negative influences of others. For instance, he told his brothers about his dreams even though it would lead them to not liking him. He resists the solicitation from the wife of Potifar because it was morally and spiritually wrong. Additionally, when Pharaoh tells Yosef that he has heard that he can interpret dreams, Yosef brazenly corrects Pharaoh’s mistake in public, saying that it is God Who interprets the dreams. The running theme is that Yosef will say and do what he is sure God wants him to do, despite social pressure to do the opposite. This is what it means to be above the ayin hara./\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, we can all be immune to the evil eye. When others try to use peer pressure to sway us from doing what is right in the eyes of God, we can stay firm and strong, and confidently resist the strong pull to seek their approval.'),
(14, 10, 'Jacob\'s life was shortened as a result of his complaint./\r\n\r\nThe powerful book \"Chassidic Tales of the Holocaust\" tells the story of a mother and her daughter, Livia, who somehow managed to survive the war. Looking out for each other, encouraging each other day after horror-filled day, they made it through the terror of several concentration camps./\r\n\r\nAfter the war, a sympathetic German woman looked at Livia and commented, \"It must have been very difficult for people your age to endure all this suffering.\"/\r\n\r\n\"How old do you think I am?\" Livia asked her./\r\n\r\n\"Maybe 60 or 62,\" replied the woman./\r\n\r\n\"No. I\'m 14,\" replied Livia./\r\n\r\nTerrified upon hearing this, the women crossed herself and fled./\r\n\r\nThe enormous effect that sorrow can have upon a person\'s visage figures prominently in this week\'s Torah portion, Vayigash. In the narrative, the aged patriarch Jacob is brought before Pharaoh and gives him a blessing. Pharaoh then asks Jacob how old he is. Jacob responds: \"Few and bad have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the years of the life of my forefathers in the days of their wanderings.\"/\r\n\r\nThe commentaries note that in fact Jacob did have a miserable life. For decades, he lived in fear that his brother Esav would murder him. Then he spent 20 years working for his wicked uncle Lavan, who constantly cheated him and made him work under the most difficult physical conditions. Then Dina, Jacob\'s only daughter, was tragically raped. Later, Jacob spent many years in sorrow, convinced that his beloved son Joseph had died./\r\n\r\nBut, despite going through all this pain (and perhaps in part because of it), Jacob managed to become a great tzaddik. In fact, he worked so hard on improving his character, that many classical sources describe Jacob as \"the most righteous person who ever lived.\"/\r\n\r\nGiven that he had reached such a high level of righteousness, Jacob\'s comment to Pharaoh about his \"life of great difficulty\" seems inappropriate. While the average person may complain about life\'s trials, a tzaddik is not supposed to!/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash goes on to describe God\'s consternation with Jacob\'s comment. The Almighty tells Jacob: \"I provided you with a refuge from Esav and Lavan, returned to you both Dina and Joseph - and you\'re complaining?!\"/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash concludes that Jacob\'s life was shortened as a result of these words of complaint. For if Jacob (or anybody else) does not fully appreciate life, then why should he be granted longevity?!/\r\n\r\nOther commentaries, however, explain the incident with Pharaoh differently. They say that Pharaoh was overwhelmed by the ancient-looking appearance of Jacob, and asked about his age. Jacob, realizing that his appearance made him seem far older than he actually was, felt compelled to explain to Pharaoh the cause of this phenomenon, and described the difficulties he had faced in his life./\r\n\r\nThus, in the view of these commentaries, Jacob\'s words were not a complaint, but rather an explanation of his appearance. As a great tzaddik, he would not (especially to a public personage such as Pharaoh) utter bitter complaints about his life. Rather, Jacob was explaining how the tragedies of life had become etched on his visage ... just as they would on his great-granddaughter, Livia, some millennia hence.'),
(15, 11, 'There is no one “right” way to respond to a traumatic event and most people deal with trauma in slightly different ways. Yet, there is research that indicates that certain environments, perspectives and behaviors lead to more adaptive responses that create the opportunity for healing. Yosef, a survivor of several traumatic events, serves as a paradigm of resilience. By analyzing Yosef’s mindset and behavior as presented in the verses and midrashim at the end of the Book of Genesis, we can identify several strategies that serve as protective factors for healthy resolutions of traumatic events./\r\n\r\nThe natural response to trauma is to try and avoid the painfulness of the experience. Yet, research indicates that the more one tries to avoid either by trying to not think about the traumatic event or by distancing oneself from anything that reminds one of the event, the greater likelihood one has of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)./\r\n\r\nConsequently, besides for being able to talk about the painful experience, one of the strategies in trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is to revisit the site of the trauma. One of the reasons why this is helpful is because it helps the person develop a “then versus now” perspective, allowing the event to feel more in the past, rather than something that is continuing to be experienced in the present./\r\n\r\nThere is a fascinating group of midrashim that suggest that on the way back from burying Yaakov, Yosef took a detour to revisit the scene of his original trauma – the infamous pit where his brothers left him to die. Standing over the pit, gazing into the abyss, he confronts the site of the trauma. At that moment, he recites a blessing: “Blessed is God (‘HaMakom’) Who performed a miracle for me in this place (‘bamakom hazeh’). This blessing reflects and reveals two important mindsets. First, as is indicated by the past grammatical tense, the blessing presupposes a break from the past. By being able to acknowledge being saved in the past, Yosef solidifies a “then versus now” perspective./\r\n\r\nThe blessing also demonstrates a second important protective factor for Yosef – the ability to find positive meaning in the trauma. Broadly speaking, the blessing serves to spiritualize and sanctify the experience. More specifically, hinted at within the wording of the blessing is a powerful message. The word used to connote God in the blessing is “HaMakom,” literally, “The Place” - “Blessed is The Place, Who performed a miracle for me at this place.” Embedded within the wording, Yosef is acknowledging what he explicitly states within the Torah verses. The whole narrative, starting with the trauma that happened at this place, reflects the Will of The Place. Yosef acknowledges the positive meaning within the trauma: God orchestrated each element of the story for the survival of the descendants of Yaakov in Egypt./\r\n\r\nFinally, the story closes with Yosef demonstrating one more protective factor, namely, helping others in their healing process. Yosef’s brothers were scared that Yosef would seek out retribution now that Yaakov died, and Yosef was in a position of power. Yosef doesn’t just reassure them that he won’t harm them and that he will provide sustenance for them, but he also “comforted them and spoke to their hearts” (Bereishit 50:21). Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch suggests that Yosef was helping them with their healing process by trying to assuage their feelings of guilt by emphasizing the Divinely ordained elements of what transpired and the positive outcomes of everyone now having enough food to survive./\r\n\r\nWhile we hope to not experience traumatic events in the first place, if we are confronted with a trauma, we can learn a number of powerful strategies from Yosef, including; revisiting the scene in a safe context to foster a “then versus now” perspective, finding meaning and positive benefit within the event, and helping others heal through their own healing process.'),
(16, 12, '\"A new king arose over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud quotes two opinions: It was either a new king or the existing monarch with new policies, who acted as if he “did not know of Joseph” (Sotah 11a). The Midrash follows the second opinion, and states that when the Egyptians turned against the Jews, Pharaoh refused to go along with them and they deposed him for three months, until he yielded to their wishes (Shemos Rabbah 1:9)./\r\n\r\nIs it not amazing that the king who said to Joseph, “Since God has informed you of all this, there can be no one so discerning and wise as you” (Genesis 41:39), now says to Moses, “Who is God that I should heed His voice to send out Israel? I do not know God” (Exodus 5:2)?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Meir Rubman cites Mishnas R\' Eliezer: “The reason the Torah is so harsh regarding an ingrate is because denial of gratitude toward another person is tantamount to denial of gratitude toward God. Today one denies gratitude toward a fellow man, and the next day he denies gratitude toward God. All of Egypt knew that Joseph had saved their land, as did Pharaoh. However, Pharaoh chose to deny gratitude toward Joseph, and thereafter denied God, saying, “Who is God that I should heed His voice? #133; I do not know God” (Lekach Tov, Shemos p. 5)/\r\n\r\nHow we relate to God depends on how we relate to other people. When the Baal Shem Tov was asked, How can one develop a love for God? How can one love a Being that one cannot see or have any sense experience of Him? He responded, “Love your fellow man. This will lead you to love of God.” Indeed, the Talmud says that the way a human being can cleave unto God is to emulate His traits: “Just as He is merciful, you should be merciful” (Shabbos 133a)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Yehudah Leib Chasman shares another insight with us. The Midrash says that Pharaoh initially resisted his people\'s demands that he enslave Jews, because he felt indebted to Joseph and to Jacob\'s blessing the land. However, when expedience required that he persecute the Jews in order to retain his throne, he became a cruel tyrant, enslaving them and ordering their children to be killed. This shows us that a person is capable of altering his emotions. A person may not say, “That\'s me. That\'s just the way I am.”/\r\n\r\nPharaoh underwent an emotional change because of his desire to keep his position. Just as a person can alter one\'s emotions negatively, so can one change one\'s emotions positively. Pharaoh was motivated by expedience. A person can also be motivated by a sincere conviction to do what is right. One need only realize which emotions are proper and have a sincere desire to cultivate them./\r\n\r\nPeople who do not wish to put forth the effort to modify their character traits may say, “I was born that way.” Rabbi Shneur Zalman says in Tanya, “It is an inborn capacity that the intellect can be master over the emotions.” The ability to change is an inborn trait. In fact, it is the most significant distinguishing feature between man and other living things. A person who denies his ability to alter his character is lowering himself to a subhuman level. Our dignity should not allow us to do this.'),
(17, 13, 'One of the first and most central interventions to help manage difficult emotions is deep breathing. When we feel intense emotions, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, our bodies tend to react physiologically by taking shorter and shallower breaths. By counteracting those quick and narrow breaths with a deeper breath, we increase the supply of oxygen to our brains, stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, and signaling to our bodies that we can calm down./\r\n\r\nAs strange as this might sound, deep breathing often requires training and practice. Many people take deep breaths with their upper chest, which can actually increase breathing rate and cause hyperventilation. An effective deep breath is known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing because it is done by focusing the breath below the rib cage, with the stomach moving, rather than the chest./\r\n\r\nToward the end of last week\'s Torah portion, we are informed that after the Children of Israel saw the signs that Moshe performed and were informed that God took note of their hardships, they were convinced and believed in the redemption to come (Shemot 4:30-31). Yet, in the beginning of Parshat Vaeira when Moshe elaborates on the message of redemption, the Children of Israel do not listen “mi-kotzer ruach u-mei-avodah kasha” – “from shortness of breath and from the hard work” (Shemot 6:8). Many commentators understand these to be two distinct reasons for not listening (see Ohr HaChaim): it was difficult to pay attention because of all the physical labor (hard work), but there was an additional psychological component of being short of breath (shortness of breath) that contributed to the inability to listen. What was this psychological impediment?/\r\n\r\nIf we survey the commentators, we can identify three distinct emotions that may have inhibited their ability to listen. The Midrash (Pesikta Zutarta) suggests that the Children of Israel were angry and that led them to subvert their original correct approach which was to believe in the redemption. While the Midrash does not state explicitly what they were angry about, perhaps it was because they were promised redemption and then nothing subsequently changed./\r\n\r\nRabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk suggests that they couldn’t process the message of hope because they were depressed. This is alluded to as well in the commentary of Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi who suggests that the Children of Israel were not psychologically prepared or receptive to messages of comfort because they were devoid of any hope. Rabbeinu Bechayei goes so far as to suggest that they were fed up with life and lost the will to live./\r\n\r\nA third group of commentators focus on fear and anxiety as hindering the message of hope. For instance, Ramban suggests that the Children of Israel were afraid that Pharaoh or the officers would kill them. Maharal adds that besides the actual physical difficulty of the labor, they were also worried about the fact that the work was so difficult./\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether one of the approaches is correct or if there is truth to all three, it is fascinating that they are all rooted in the term kotzer ruach, shortness of breath. The metaphor used to encapsulate emotional distress – whether anger, depression, or anxiety – is shortness of breath. Without critiquing our ancestors’ reaction in Egypt, perhaps we can learn a message for our own lower-level “hard work – avoda kasha” experiences. When we are confronted with difficulties and react with the shortness of breath of an unhealthy emotion, let us take a step back and take some deep breaths. If we can manage our anger, depression, or anxiety, perhaps we will have enough headspace to listen to the messages of hope and redemption.'),
(18, 14, 'Sometimes a task seems too difficult, daunting, or incongruent with our personality that we elect to be passive. We may garner some motivation for action from phrases such as “fake it till you make it,” but still feel resistant because we feel inauthentic or disingenuous to make it by faking it./\r\n\r\nIn one of the most popular Ted Talks and in her bestselling book “Presence: Bringing your Boldest Self to your Biggest Challenges,” social psychologist, Amy Cuddy, encourages us to adapt the phrase from “fake it till you make it” to “fake it till you become it.” She makes her case for this subtle, yet significant, difference, based on her research on body posture. When people change and “fake” their body posture from reflecting being closed off and timid to an open, power posture (think a Superman pose), they feel more confident, are more willing to act courageously, and even their body chemistry changes. Their cortisol (the stress hormone) decreases and their testosterone (the assertiveness hormone) increases. “Faking” their body posture doesn’t just help them succeed, it actually changes their personality until they “become” it./\r\n\r\nAs the Children of Israel prepare to leave Egypt, they are given many laws related to the Passover sacrifice, one of which is that it is forbidden to break the bone of the sacrifice. Commentators struggle as to the meaning and depth behind this commandment. Some commentators suggest that not breaking the bones reflects a rushed mentality that was essential for leaving Egypt. People in a rush don’t have time to break a bone and suck out the marrow. They quickly eat the meat and throw away the bone (see Rashbam and Bechor Shor)./\r\n\r\nOthers see a character flaw within the act of breaking the bones. It can be seen as gluttonous and excessive to break a bone to suck out the marrow, which reflects poorly on the eater, is degrading to the honor befitting of the sacrifice, and calls into question the validity of the sacrifice, which needs to be eaten when one is full./\r\n\r\nIt is within the context of this mitzvah that the Sefer HaChinuch presents his famous thesis that our personality is influenced by our actions (“acharei ha-peulot nimshachim ha-levavot”). Preempting his son’s question as to why the Torah would provide so many laws related to the Exodus, the Sefer HaChinuch explains that the purpose of this mitzvah, and mitzvot in general, is to provide us with actions that inculcate character. By not breaking the bones we are demonstrating our break from slavery and our new existence of freedom. It is not proper, he argues, for people of stature to break bones while eating. Therefore, when exiting servitude, the Children of Israel are called upon to act like royalty, even if they don’t feel like royalty. They – and by extension, we – are encouraged to not just fake it till we make it, but fake it till we become it.');

(19, 15, 'We are generally aware that what we eat impacts our overall health and eating unhealthily can put us at risk for the development of numerous physical diseases. Yet, there is also mounting research that what we eat also greatly affects our intellectual abilities and our emotional health. Our diets affect the neurotransmitters in our brains which can impact our cognitive functioning and our moods. Diets high in refined sugar impair our thinking abilities and tend to focus us on pursuing even more food with high sugar content. Cognitive decline has also been associated with diets high in cholesterol and saturated fats. In contrast, diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and unsaturated fats, like omega-3, are linked with increased cognitive and emotional health./\r\n\r\nWhen introducing the concept of the manna, God frames the miracle as a test for the Children of Israel to see if they will follow in his laws. The commentators differ in their understanding of the nature of this test and which laws are being tested. Rashi suggests that the test is whether they will follow the rules specific to the manna, which includes a restriction against leaving any leftover or for going out to collect it on Shabbat. Ramban disagrees and writes that the test is not whether they will follow the laws, but whether they will trust in God to follow Him through the wilderness, despite the lack of natural food sources. Chizkuni offers a third interpretation: since God is providing free food from the Heaven – which does not require a lot of preparation time before eating – the test is whether the Children of Israel will use their free time to study Torah./\r\n\r\nElaborating on this last theme, Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz suggests that the manna served to counteract each of three broad categories of impediments to learning Torah. One, is that we tend to spend lots of time in the pursuit of securing food for consumption. Since the Children of Israel were in the middle of the desert, they would have to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy just to find food, something they did not have to do now that they had the manna./\r\n\r\nA second impediment is that those who have lots of food (or money) tend to spend a lot of time busying themselves with protecting and growing their savings, which can detract from the amount of time learning. Therefore, there were strict limitations on the amount of manna one could gather, preventing anyone from amassing a distracting amount of food.\r\n\r\nA third impediment to proper Torah learning is the food itself. Writing in the seventeenth century, Rabbi Luntschitz observed that certain coarse and heavy foods diminished the clarity and effectiveness of people’s thinking so that they could not focus properly on intellectual pursuits. The manna did not have any of these detrimental cognitive effects, ensuring the Children of Israel\'s ability to focus on learning Torah. The test, therefore, was whether they would use their free time for the pursuit of Torah if all of these impediments were removed./\r\n\r\nWhile we aren’t blessed with the miracle of manna now, we would do well to try and incorporate some of the lessons into our own lives. This includes a broad reminder about following God’s laws and trusting in Him to provide for us. But it also provides for us a moment to reflect on our eating habits and how they affect our general spiritual productivity. Do we spend more time than necessary buying, preparing, and eating various foods that are not necessarily essential to our well-being? Could we cut out some of that time and apply it to learning Torah and doing acts of kindness? Can we prioritize eating foods that help boost our cognitive abilities and stay away from ones that give us brain fog and make us feel sluggish?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps even without the manna we can do our best to replicate the benefits our ancestors were afforded with this powerful, yet challenging, miracle.\r\n\r\n'),
(20, 16, 'And they encamped in the Wilderness and Israel encamped there, opposite the mountain [Sinai] #(19:2)/\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the narration that precedes the giving of the Torah is more than just historical. It indicates the prerequisites of Torah./\r\n\r\nRashi points out that the Hebrew word for encamped is vayichan, he camped, rather than vayachanu, they camped. Furthermore, the Ten Commandments were also spoken in the singular, Anochi Hashem Elokecha, your God in the singular, rather than the plural elokeichem. The singular form of the verb is utilized because there was such complete unity among the Israelites that they were like one person, hence the entire nation could be addressed in the singular./\r\n\r\nThe Torah was given to each individual, and every person is required to fulfill the 613 mitzvot. It is obvious that technically this is impossible. There are some mitzvot whose performance is restricted to Kohanim (priests), which Yisrael cannot perform. A person whose firstborn child is a girl cannot fulfill the mitzvah of pidyon haben (redemption of the firstborn son). Mitzvot that apply to judges do not apply to lay people. How can any single person fulfill all 613 mitzvot?/\r\n\r\nTorah scholars have provided the answer. When a person puts on the tefillin (phylacteries) on his arm and head, it is not just the arm and head that have the mitzvah, but the whole person. Similarly, when people are united, they are as one, and a mitzvah performed by one person is shared by those with whom one is united./\r\n\r\nHow tragic that we have allowed ourselves to be divisive. Fragmentation not only weakens our nation, but deprives a person of acquiring the merit of those mitzvot which he is unable to perform./\r\n\r\nEvery human trait may have positive applications, even something as repulsive as selfishness. We should realize that eliminating the divisiveness that reigns among us is not merely altruistic. It is of inestimable personal benefit./\r\n\r\nIt is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of Rabbi Avraham Twerski, who passed away Sunday, Jan 31, 18 of Shevat.

(21, 17, 'Six days shall you accomplish your activities, and on the seventh day you shall desist, in order that your ox and donkey may rest #(23:12)/\r\n\r\nThere are some verses on which Rashi comments, “this verse demands an interpretation”; i.e., it cannot be taken literally. The above verse is one that demands an interpretation./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that if a person observes Shabbos properly, it is as if he observed the entire Torah, whereas if one violates Shabbos, it is as if he violated the entire Torah (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 3). The Torah repeats the commandment of observing Shabbos several times, and it is one of the Ten Commandments. Yet, if we take the above verse literally, “in order that your ox and donkey may rest,” it would seem that the sole purpose of Shabbos is to provide respite for work animals. That can hardly be true. We must, therefore, look for another meaning in this verse, and the Torah commentaries provide it for us.\r\n\r\nThe mussar authorities say that the ox is the symbol of strength and energy, while the mule is a symbol of indolence and obstinacy. This is why, when the Torah wishes to tell us that a combined effort by two people or animals of opposite nature is prohibited, it states, “You shall not plow with an ox and a mule together” (Deuteronomy 22:10; Chinuch, Mitzvah 550)./\r\n\r\nWe have a variety of character traits, in some of which we take pride, others we may wish to disown. The chassidic and mussar writings say that all human traits can be channeled into constructive channels. A person may wish to deny his feelings of aggression or obstinacy. There is no need to deny these. Rather, they should be directed toward constructive goals./\r\n\r\nIn psychology, there is the concept of sublimation. It is theorized that the subconscious mind can redirect an unacceptable drive toward proper goals. Thus, psychologists say, an astronomer who peers through a telescope or a scientist who looks through a microscope has converted a voyeuristic drive into a constructive curiosity. Although sublimation is certainly a beneficial mechanism, it is not accomplished consciously. The person has no awareness of the origin of his scientific curiosity./\r\n\r\nOur ethicists say that there is no need to deny or repress any urge or drive. These are part of our physiological makeup. Rather, we should allow ourselves to be aware of them and consciously redirect them. But this requires introspection and self-examination, something which most people have little time to do. We are too occupied with our daily activities to take time out for meditation, contemplation and soul-searching./\r\n\r\nShabbos provides the opportunity for introspection. “Six days shall you accomplish your activities, and on the seventh day you shall desist.” Desist and refrain from all your usual activities. Freeze your aggressive, assertive, indolent and obstinate traits. Let them not be manipulated by subconscious mechanisms. Allow them to be at rest, where you can examine them and see what you can do with them./\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a worthy function of Shabbos. It gives a person the opportunity to enhance one’s spirituality by becoming the finest human being one can be.'),
(22, 18, '\"The only thing I know, is that I know nothing.” This idea, known as the Socratic Paradox, lays the groundwork for the perspective that knowledge is not something to be attained. In the modern psychology and educational literature this is expressed in the distinction between achievement and mastery orientations./\r\n\r\nPeople who have an achievement orientation want to demonstrate that they have accomplished and learned, while those with a mastery orientation want to develop their abilities, irrespective of actual attainment of a goal or an understanding of a particular piece of knowledge./\r\n\r\nThose that display a mastery orientation tend to do better academically, put in more effort, persist through challenges, and tend to love learning more than those with an achievement orientation./\r\n\r\nIn a striking passage, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv (Chochma U’Mussar, p. 344) quotes this idea from Socrates as a springboard to discuss the view of the Sages, which he suggests is identical to that of Socrates. Featured most prominently in his argument is the fact that the term used to describe a person engaged in Torah study is “talmid chacham” – a student of wisdom. Even the greatest sage, who has amassed encyclopedic knowledge and can plumb the depths of Talmudic analysis, is still called a student./\r\n\r\nTo bolster his idea, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv quotes the Baal HaTurim (Shemot 25:18), who suggests, based on the Gemara (Sukkah 5b), that the Cherubs, the Keruvim that sat above the ark were fashioned in the image of children. This understanding is based on the fact that the word Keruv is usually spelled kaf-reish-vov-vet, but in this instance, it is spelled without the vov (kaf-reish-vet). Rabbi Abbahu connects this to the Aramaic word ravya, which means child. The Keruv, is ke-ravya – like a child. The image of the child represents a never-ending curiosity, thirst, and quest to learn and discover./\r\n\r\nRabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz (Keli Yakar) finds the same idea embedded within the dimensions of the ark. He first observes that the dimensions of the Altar were five, by five, by three (5x5x3); the dimensions of the Table were two, by one, by one and a half (2x1x1.5); and the dimensions of the Ark were two and a half, by one and a half, by one and half (2.5x1.5x1.5). The Altar was comprised of whole numbers, the Table of a mixture of whole and half numbers, and the Ark of completely half numbers. While he also explains the symbolism of this pattern for the Altar and the Table, for our purposes, his explanation of the Ark’s half numbers is pertinent. The reason, he argues, is because the Ark represents Torah and half measurements represent incompleteness. Every learner should take the perspective that they are not a finished product. There is always more to learn. There is always room to grow./\r\n\r\nThis message is countercultural. We are a society obsessed with certificates, grades, accolades, and accomplishments. Our systems, institutions, and classrooms tend to foster achievement orientations. Yet, we can never become complete and whole in our learning – there is no graduation. To the extent that we can cultivate a mastery orientation for ourselves, for our children and for our students, the better learners we will become. We are all students, we are all keruvim, we are all children, we are all incomplete. The only thing we really know, is that we know nothing.'),
(23, 19, 'How often do you feel awe, admiration, and elevation while witnessing beauty and excellence?/\r\n\r\nAppreciation is one of the 24 character strengths and virtues outlined by psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman that enhance well-being. They define appreciation as the “ability to find, recognize, and take pleasure in the existence of goodness in the physical and social worlds.”/\r\n\r\nPeterson and Seligman make an important distinction between three different types of goodness that one can feel and show appreciation for: 1) physical beauty, 2) skill or talent, 3) virtue or moral goodness. María Luisa Martínez-Martí and her colleagues reported in a recent study that individuals who score high on an Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence scale (which includes all three types of appreciation) generally report higher senses of well-being, life-satisfaction, purpose, and hope. They also report more impactful spiritual experiences, and are more empathetic, sympathetic, and concerned for the well-being of others./\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the sheer number of verses related to the construction of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the clothing of the Kohanim, that the Torah is deeply interested in transmitting a theology of beauty. Moses is commanded in the beginning of this week\'s Torah portion to make holy garments for his brother Aharon “lekavod u-le-tifaret“ – “for honor and for beauty” (Shemot 28:2). The commentators differ on the exact meaning of the verse. Elements of the dispute rest on a textual ambiguity, which perhaps also reflects a deeper spiritual message./\r\n\r\nTextually, it is unclear which noun “for honor and beauty” is modifying. Some understand that the clothing itself must be honorable and beautiful, so that if it is ripped or worn out, it would be invalid (Ralbag). Others argue that it is the Kohen Gadol, the High Priest, who is being honored and beautified by the clothing, as the garments described were also worn by royalty (Ramban)./\r\n\r\nStill others argue that it is not the clothing, nor is it the Kohen Gadol, who is being honored, but it is God (Sforno) or the Mishkan (Rambam) that is being beautified by the special clothing. Regardless of which approach we take, it is evident that there is an inherent value in magnifying and glorifying the physical beauty as it relates to deeply sacred rituals. The spiritual experience is enhanced by the surrounding physical beauty./\r\n\r\nYet, the sense of awe and appreciation is not limited to the realm of just physical beauty. Inherent in witnessing and experiencing the presence of the Kohen Gadol was also an appreciation of skill and talent. As is evident from the verses describing the performance of the sacrificial rituals, especially in the context of Yom Kippur, the work of the Kohen Gadol was complicated and required practice, precision, and determination. No doubt, spectators witnessing the Kohen Gadol (and even modern readers imagining the ancient scene) feel a sense of awe and appreciation of the skill and talent required to successfully execute the rituals./\r\n\r\nIn his commentary, Aderet Eliyahu, Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Baghdad, better known as the Ben Ish Chai, adds the final dimension of appreciation into the mix, namely, virtue and moral goodness. He argues that clothing cannot be an inherent symbol of character. If someone who is known to demonstrate low moral fortitude wears royal or regal attire, the contrast between his or her internal flaws and the external pretense, makes the wearer even lower in the eyes of others. It is only if the onlookers know for certain the pristine character of the wearer of the garments that the clothing can enhance his or her stature./\r\n\r\nThere is a Talmudic tradition that the Kohen Gadol could only emerge from the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur if he was of high moral character. Therefore, when the Kohen Gadol emerged on Yom Kippur, everyone was aware of his virtue. The beauty of his priestly garments was integrally intertwined with the beauty of his virtue, character, and moral goodness./\r\n\r\nThe Mishkan, and particularly the role of the Kohen Gadol within it, provides a paradigm for us to nurture our own sense of appreciation. If we can learn how to cultivate this trait within a spiritual paradigm, combining an appreciation of beauty, talent, and virtue, we can enhance and deepen our relationship with ourselves, with others, and with God.'),
(24, 20, 'It happened as he [Moses] drew near the camp and saw the calf and the dances, that Moses\' anger flared up. He threw down the Tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain #(32:19)/\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable Midrash which states that when God said to Moses, “Go, descend – for your people that you brought up from Egypt have become corrupt,” Moses held on to the Tablets and did not believe that the Israelites had sinned. He said, “If I do not see it, I do not believe it,” for the Torah says, “It happened as he [Moses] drew near the camp and saw the calf and the dances,” hence, he did not break the Tablets until he saw it with his own eyes./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash continues, “Woe unto those people who testify to what they did not see. Is it possible that Moses did not believe it when God said to him, `your people have become corrupt?\' But Moses wished to teach the Israelites proper behavior. Even if one hears something critical from a trustworthy person, one is not permitted to accept his word and take action on it if he does not see it himself” (Shemos Rabbah 46:1)./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash seems to say that Moses did in fact believe God, but that he acted as if he did not in order to set an example for the people. However, the Midrash earlier is very clear: “Moses held on to the Tablets and did not believe that the Israelites had sinned. He said, `If I do not see it, I do not believe it.\'”/\r\n\r\nThe resolution of this apparent contradiction is that Moses did not believe God because he knew that God did not wish that he believe Him. Moses knew that God desires only what is proper, and inasmuch as it is proper not to believe anything negative about others unless one sees it oneself, God did not want Moses to believe Him. Moses did not act “as if.” His example and teaching were factual./\r\n\r\nWe find a similar incident when God told Moses to go to Egypt to deliver the Israelites from their enslavement. Moses said, “I must first ask permission from my father-in-law, Jethro” (Rashi, Exodus 4:18). How dare he refuse to follow God\'s command until he received Jethro\'s permission? Rabbi Chaim Shmulevits explains that Moses understood God\'s will, that inasmuch as Jethro was hospitable to him when he fled from Pharaoh, God would not want him to depart without seeking his permission./\r\n\r\nThe Torah forbids speaking lashon hara (defamatory speech) and rechilus (talebearing). The Chafetz Chaim says that one who accepts lashon hara or talebearing is as sinful as the one who spreads them. In fact, even when one does see an apparent wrongdoing with one\'s own eyes, one should still give the person the benefit of doubt and assume that there must be compelling reasons for the person\'s action (Ethics of the Fathers 1:6)./\r\n\r\nIf we observe Hillel\'s principle, “Do not do anything to others that you would not want done to you,” we can avoid both speaking and listening to lashon hara and talebearing.'),
(25, 21, 'Every wise-hearted person among you shall come and make everything that God has commanded #(35:10) Every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands (Exodus, 35:25)\r\nHe [God] filled them with a wise heart to do ... every craft (35:35)\r\nThe wise-hearted among those doing the work made the Tabernacle (36:8)/\r\n\r\nThe repeated references to the trait of “wise-hearted” cannot be without significance./\r\n\r\nOn the verse, “Every man whose heart inspired him came” (Exodus 35:21), Ramban comments that none of the Israelites had learned the skills necessary for the work of the Sanctuary and the vestments. However, because they were intensely motivated to do the Divine will, they discovered that they were in fact able to do the skilled craftsmanship. This might be interpreted as a miraculous endowment of skills they had not had. However, the words of Ramban indicate that it was not an endowment of something new. Rather, it was a discovery that they had these skills within them./\r\n\r\nThis is an important lesson. Clinically, I repeatedly encounter people who are not aware of their inherent skills and personality assets. In my writings on self-esteem I point out that not only are many people oblivious of their personality assets and potential, but even when these are pointed out to them, they persist in denying them. One can only wonder why intelligent people are not able to accept such factual information./\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon in psychotherapy to repeatedly point out something to a patient, but it does not have the slightest impact upon him. After regularly pointing this out for a year and a half, there is a sudden insight. The patient may then say, “Doctor, I\'ve been coming here for a year and a half. Why haven\'t you ever pointed this out to me before?”/\r\n\r\nDuring the year and a half of therapy, when the therapist interpreted the patient\'s symptoms, the patient said, “I understand everything you\'ve said, but it doesn\'t make me feel any better.” I can conclude only that intellect is subordinate to emotion, and that intellectual knowledge that is not accompanied by emotional knowledge is ineffective. If there are emotional factors that do not allow a person to accept something about himself, whether it is something good or something bad, no amount of intellectual information will register./\r\n\r\nAccording to Ramban, this is what happened with the Israelites. Many people did not have an inkling that they had the requisite skills for the intricate work in crafting the vessels, vestments and curtains of the Sanctuary. But their devotion to God and their desire to do His will resulted in “their hearts being elevated in the ways of God” (II Chronicles 17:6). Their spirits soared, and the emotional fervor enabled them to discover the skills within them./\r\n\r\nWe usually think of wisdom as associated with the mind and brain rather than with the heart. We associate the heart with emotions rather than with wisdom. The Torah repeatedly refers to the “wise-hearted” to indicate the overriding influence of emotion over intellect, and that only when one\'s emotions permit can one implement the powers of the intellect./\r\n\r\nWe have untouched reserves of both physical and mental abilities. Under conditions of stress, people have been known to perform physical feats that they never thought were within their capacities. There is reason to believe that some geniuses were not of such superior intellect, but rather that their emotional investment allowed them to fully utilize their potential./\r\n\r\nThis is an important principle in education. If we can stimulate interest and desire for knowledge in children, they are likely to excel in their studies. A good teacher is, therefore, one who can reach the students in a way that they become “wise-hearted.”'),
(26, 22, 'Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood (37:1).\r\n\r\nRashi says that because Bezalel dedicated himself to the work of the Ark more than others, it bears his name: the Ark that Bezalel made.\r\n\r\nIn Exodus 25:10, the Torah says, “They shall make an Ark of acacia wood.” The Midrash notes that for all the other appurtenances of the Sanctuary, God said to Moses, “You shall make,” but in the case of the Ark, He said, “They shall make.” The Midrash explains this exception; God said to Moses, “Let everyone participate in the fashioning of the Ark so that all will have the merit of Torah” (Shemos Rabbah 34:3). There seems to be a bit of a conflict here. God instructed that everyone should share in the construction of the Ark, yet it appears as though Bezalel did it almost single-handedly.\r\n\r\nRabbi Boruch Sorotzkin says that the message herein is that when Torah is involved, one should not assume that others will do their part, but rather act as if one were the only person who could carry out the responsibility. Although all the Israelites were obligated to share in the Ark, Bezalel approached it as if he were the only one available to fashion it.\r\n\r\nThere is the well-known story of the shul that asked all its members to donate a cup of wine. Each member reasoned that everyone else would donate wine, so he could get away with putting in a cup of water. When they came to fetch wine from the barrel, it was all pure water! That is what may happen when one relies on others to do the task. Every person may rationalize that others will do it.\r\n\r\nRabbi Sorotzkin\'s observation is relevant to all commandments as well as to Torah. When there is something to be done, do not rely on others, even if they share the responsibility. Act as if you were the only person available and capable of doing the task.'),
(27, 23, 'In their book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), Drs. Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson explain the psychology behind why many of us have difficulty admitting mistakes. They describe the various tricks our brains use to defend our egos from noticing our shortcomings, including cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, naïve-realism, and memory distortions. The basic gist behind all of these tricks is that our mind “yearns for consonance and rejects information that questions our beliefs, decisions, or preferences.”/\r\n\r\nYet, the thrust of Tavris and Aronsons’s argument is that we could go a long way to compensate for these cognitive errors by just being aware that they exist and are in danger of deluding reality./\r\n\r\nThe Torah describes four different inadvertent sins that require different sacrificial atonements, depending on who sinned: the High Priest, the court, the leader, or a regular individual. While for the High Priest, the court, and the individual, the Torah frames the sacrifices based on the condition of “if” they sin (“im”), when it comes to the leader, the verse uses the word “asher” – “when the leader sins.” Commentators are bothered by the assumption. Why do we assume the inevitably of the leader’s sin?/\r\n\r\nIbn Ezra circumvents the problem by arguing that the word “asher” is synonymous with the word “im” and also means “if,” not “when.” Others take the change in wording more seriously and suggest that there is a fundamental difference between a leader and the other three groups. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks quotes three different explanations including that a leader is more prone to arrogance (Sforno), is more involved in secular pursuits (Rabbi Eliyahu Munk) and can be easily strayed by popular opinion (Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk). Rabbi Sacks suggests a fourth answer which stresses the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in making political decisions./\r\n\r\nRashi, quoting the midrash, takes the discussion in another direction by focusing on a different function of the word “asher,” as it also doubles as an allusion to the word “ashrei,” meaning happy, praiseworthy, or fortunate. “Fortunate is the generation,” he writes, “whose leader sets his heart to bring an atonement sacrifice even for an inadvertent sin; how much more certain is it that he will repent for his willful sins.” It isn’t easy for any of us to admit our mistakes. We have so many cognitive distortions that conceal our mistakes from our awareness. It is even more common for leaders to not see their mistakes because the stakes are higher. It is indeed worthy of pausing and celebrating such leaders who are willing to admit their mistakes and are able to model proper behavior for others./\r\n\r\nHow do we overcome all the obstacles that prevent us from seeing our mistakes? I believe the answer lies within a careful reading of Rashi’s commentary. If we pay close attention, we will notice that Rashi formulates the idea slightly differently than the sources he is quoting from. The Tosefta, the Talmud Bavli, the Sifra, and the Yalkut Shimoni all write “fortunate is the generation whose leader offers a sacrifice for his unintentional sins.” Rashi adds the words “notein leiv” – “sets his heart.” “Fortunate is the generation whose leader is “notein leiv” sets his heart to offer a sacrifice for his unintentional sins. The path to be able to admit mistakes is to pay attention – to be “notein leiv.” As Drs. Tavris and Aronson argued, the way to overcome our biases is to be aware that we have them in the first place. If we are become aware of the tricks our minds play on us to protect our egos and become mindful and pay attention, we have a chance at being able to recognize and admit when we make mistakes.'),
(28, 24, 'New Year’s is a time for a new you. When we change the calendar from one year to the next it serves as a marker and motivator for personal change. Wharton professor Katherine Milkman termed this psychological phenomenon the “fresh start effect.” In explaining the mindset behind this theory on Freakonomics Radio, Milkman argued that we dissociate ourselves from last year’s failures – “Those are not me. That’s old me. That’s not new me. New me isn’t going to make these mistakes.”/\r\n\r\nHer formulation is reminiscent of Maimonides’ language in his Laws of Repentance, where he writes that part of the change process requires a symbolic name change, as if to say, “I am a different person and not the same one who sinned.”\r\n\r\nMilkman and her colleagues hypothesized that this dissociation with our past selves was not just confined to New Year’s but that there were other temporal landmarks throughout the calendar that spark improved behavior. To test their theory, they downloaded eight years’ worth of Google searches for the word “diet” and found that people search “diet” more at the outset of a new week, month, year, and semester; or after a birthday or a holiday. They found similar results when investigating when people go to the gym – there is a boost in attendance after these “new” opportunities for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nFrom a Jewish calendric perspective, Rosh Hashanah, the Ten Days of Repentance, and Yom Kippur embody a fresh start perspective, where change is embedded within the framework of the new year. However, to constrain change and fresh starts to just that time of the year is severely limiting. Each new month also presents an opportunity for transformation. This is highlighted with Rosh Chodesh celebrations, and is especially pertinent for those who have the custom of fasting and repenting the day before each new month (known as Yom Kippur Katan).\r\n\r\nYet, the opportunities aren’t limited to new years or new months. Parshat Tzav begins with the laws of the burnt offering. An essential part of the sacrificial process was that the priest ceremoniously separated the ashes of the previous day’s sacrifice and removed them from the camp (Vayikra 6:4). Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch explains that this act signifies that every day is a fresh start, calling us “to go to our mission with full new devotion and sacrifice.” One application of this symbolism, Rabbi Hirsch asserts, is the importance of not being complacent with yesterday’s accomplishment, starting fresh with the same energy despite the somewhat repetitive nature of existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can suggest another message. Despite the “burnt” parts of yesterday, we are called on each day to start fresh. Remove yesterday’s shortcomings and start from scratch today. While new years, months, and weeks, provide an opportunity for reflection, the truth is, that every day does as well. The imperative of repentance and improvement is one that is operative all year long, not just during the High Holidays.\r\n\r\nLooking for temporal landmarks on the calendar to give us boosted motivation to change is important. But we don’t have to wait for the first of the year, the first of the month, or next Monday until we start improving. Every day is a fresh start.'),
(29, 25, 'On the Eight Day of the inauguration of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle, a celebration is in order as God’s Glory appears and a fire descends, symbolizing the successful acceptance of the sacrifices. Yet the elation turns quickly to tragedy, when another fire descends, but this time, to consume Aharon’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, after they offer a foreign fire on the altar./\r\n\r\nAharon is silent. The ceremony must proceed as planned. The usual regulations of mourning are suspended. Moshe informs Aharon and his remaining children to eat from the Meal and Peace offerings as intended but does not mention anything specifically about the Sin offering. When he discovers that they burned the whole animal and didn’t eat it, Moshe expresses anger./\r\n\r\nAharon defends the decision, arguing that after all he has experienced on that day, God wouldn’t want them to eat that sacrifice. Moshe hears Aharon’s argument and is pleased. The Sages explain that Moshe knew the law that they shouldn’t have eaten the Sin offering, but forgot. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabba 13) identifies this as one of the three times Moshe became angry and consequently, forgot a law./\r\n\r\nAnother Midrash (Sifra) reports a fascinating dispute between two sages as to the sequencing of the problem. Did Moshe’s anger cause him to make a mistake or did his mistake cause him to get angry? Chanania ben Yehuda argues that Moshe’s anger led to his mistake. However, Rabbi Yehuda questions this analysis because if it wasn’t for the mistake, he never would have become angry in the first place. The mistake led to the anger, not the other way around.1\r\n\r\nIt is unclear which sage is correct with regards to Moshe. Yet, for the psychological message, we don’t have to pick a winner. They are both true. Anger both causes mistakes and is rooted in mistakes. The fact that anger causes mistakes is quite obvious. When we are angry, we tend to speak or act in ways that we later regret. Mistakes caused by anger destroy careers, damage relationships, and devastate families./\r\n\r\nLess apparent, yet perhaps more important, anger is also rooted in mistakes. Some argue that we cannot control the way we feel. Emotions, they argue, just happen to us without any conscious control. Yet, mounting evidence indicates otherwise. Our thoughts, beliefs, expectations, perceptions and attitudes impact the way we feel. A core principle of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is that by working on identifying, challenging, and changing our thought processes, we can change our emotional experiences to be healthier.2/\r\n\r\nThe thoughts that lead to an unhealthy anger are almost always mistaken. They are what are referred to as cognitive distortions or irrational beliefs. While we should always be hesitant of critiquing Moses, following the lead of the two Midrashim above, at the very least we can try to glean a lesson for our own self-improvement. In Moshe’s case it seems his mistake was that he didn’t remember all the facts of the case and then jumped to the conclusion that the others were wrong./\r\n\r\nAre we prone to jumping to conclusions, to making judgments before we have all the facts? Do we yell at our kids, siblings, parents, friends, coworkers, or employees, before clarifying the whole story? If yes, it may be worth our while to work on training our brains to slow down, examine the situation from all sides and ask clarifying questions of others. By changing our mistaken thinking, we can change our emotions and help avoid the consequences that unhealthy emotions have on our relationships./\r\n\r\n1.See Ohr HaChaim for a fuller analysis of the Midrash.

(30, 26, 'Viktor Frankl was a famous Jewish psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor. In his 1946 book, Man’s Search for Meaning, he chronicles his experiences in Auschwitz and the tenets of his psychotherapeutic method, logotherapy, which he argues is what helped him cope through the traumatic and horrific experiences of the Holocaust. Three of his essential and related messages are that (1) we all have free will to choose our mental responses, even amidst suffering; (2) our mission in life should be to seek meaning, not to merely gain pleasure or to avoid pain; and (3) we obtain meaning by living a life that focuses on values and ideals./\r\n\r\nIn describing the wisdom, internal structure, and depth of the Hebrew alphabet, the mystical work Sefer Yetzira highlights the connection between the word nega (affliction; spelled nun-gimmel-ayin ) and the word oneg (pleasure; spelled ayin-nun-gimmel): “There is no good higher than oneg and no evil lower than nega.” The word nega is used often in Parshiyot Tazria and Metzora to describe the disease of tzara’at. Building off of the Sefer Yetzira, several commentators reflect on the relationship of the nega of tzara’at to the inverse concept of oneg, pleasure./\r\n\r\nFor example, Rabbi Yissocher Frand quotes and eloborates on the Chidushei HaRim, pointing out that the only difference between oneg and nega is the place of the ayin within the word. In oneg the ayin is in the front of the word and in nega it is at the end. When explaining the laws pertaining to tzara’at of clothing, the pasuk states that if after washing, “the affliction has not changed its appearance (ha-nega lo hafach et eyno)… it is contaminated… (Vayikra 12:55). The Chidushei HaRim suggests a homiletic reading. The term “et eyno,” translated as “its appearance” can be read as “its ayin,” referencing the letter ayin, with an additional layer of meaning, namely, its eye, or vision. The difference between a nega and oneg is a matter of ayin, or perspective./\r\n\r\nTo be clear, oneg in this context does not mean physical pleasure, nor does it necessarily mean a surreal, detached, obliviousness to pain. Oneg is a spiritual pleasure, which doesn’t completely negate pain, but alleviates it by infusing meaning. It is the pleasure that comes when despite pain, one can change one’s perspective and still commit oneself to living a life steeped in values and ideals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is why, as the Sefat Emet explains, the impurity of the metzora lasts seven days, as it ensures that he or she experiences Shabbat as part of the process. The pleasure and meaning one derives from Shabbat are reparative. Sefat Emet also points out that the word tzara’at (tzadi-reish-ayin-tav) has the same letters as the word atzeret (ayin-tzadi-reish-tav), which is a reference to the holiday of Shavuot. Shavuot, representing the acceptance and study of Torah, provides the antidote for the pain and suffering of tzara’at./\r\n\r\nWhile we generally hope to avoid pain and suffering, in cases where it is out of our control, the only thing in our control, is our response. While it is incredibly challenging, we can work on shifting our perspective and investing our lives with value and meaning, despite the pain. By suffusing our lives with the meaning that permeates a Torah lifestyle, we can hopefully change any nega we may experience to one of oneg.'),
(31, 27, 'If a person (adam) will have on his skin . . .a tzaraas affliction (Vayikra, 13:2)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud is very clear that the affliction of tzaraas (the exact nature of which is unknown to us) is a punishment for having spoken lashon hara, derogatory speech./\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word the Torah uses for “person” in the above verse is adam. There are several other Hebrew words for “person”: enosh, ish, gever. The ethical writings state that each refers to a level of spirituality, and adam represents the highest level. We must understand, therefore, the Torah\'s choice of the word adam for a person afflicted with tzaraas./\r\n\r\nThe Chafetz Chaim said that the juxtaposition of this portion of the Torah to that of the previous portion dealing with non-kosher animals is to teach us that people who may be meticulously careful about what goes into their mouths should be equally as scrupulous about what comes out of their mouths. There are sins which a Torah observant person would never do, but as for lashon hara, it is a rare person who is saved from it (Bava Basra 164b). Hence, even a spiritual person, adam, is vulnerable to lashon hara./\r\n\r\nThe Midrash relates that a peddler went through the streets shouting, “Who wishes to buy an elixir of life?” R\' Yannai, who was engrossed in his Torah study, asked to see his wares. The peddler said to him, “For you I have nothing.” Upon R\' Yannai\'s insistence, the peddler took out a Book of Psalms and showed him the verse, “Who is the person who desires life and loves days that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech” (Psalms 34:13-14). R\' Yannai then said, “All my life I have been reciting this psalm, but I never understood it until this peddler pointed it out to me” (Vayikra Rabbah 16:2)./\r\n\r\nThis Midrash has puzzled many Torah scholars. What was in these verses that he had never grasped previously? The words of the psalm could not be any clearer: Guarding one\'s tongue from lashon hara is conducive to long life./\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may understand this by examining the Talmudic statement that the remedy for lashon hara is the study of Torah (Arachin 15b). A number of commentaries ask, In what way is Torah study a penance for lashon hara? The Jewish law is that if you have offended someone, it is essential that you make amends to that person and ask his forgiveness. They answer that it is not the study of Torah per se that constitutes penance. Rather, the study of Torah will enable a person to understand the gravity of lashon hara so that he will do what is necessary for penance./\r\n\r\nThe gravity of lashon hara can be seen in the episode of Joseph and his brothers, which was brought about by his speaking derogatorily about them (Genesis 37:2), and in what happened to the prophetess, Miriam, when she spoke improperly regarding Moses (Numbers 12:1-10). To this very day, we are suffering the consequences of the lashon hara delivered by the spies to Moses (ibid. 13:31-32). This should make one cognizant of how far-reaching the effects of lashon hara can be, and how diligent one must be to do proper teshuvah./\r\n\r\nWhile the mitzvah of studying Torah is extraordinarily great (Shabbos 127a), the Talmud points out that Torah can be a double-edged sword. “If one merits, Torah can be an elixir of life; if one is not virtuous, Torah can be a deadly poison” (Yoma 72b). How penetrating these words are! If used improperly, Torah can be destructive./\r\nThe impact of derogatory speech depends on the character of the speaker. If a person who has little credibility makes a negative comment about someone, people are likely to dismiss it as worthless babble. However, if the speaker is a person of stature, a scholar whose opinion carries some weight, the attitude towards his words is, “If he says so, it must be true. He knows what he is talking about.” The more learned a person is and the higher he is held in esteem, the more his words are taken seriously./\r\n\r\nThe Baal Shem Tov taught that every human character trait can be put to good use. But what about vanity? This is so abominable a trait that it repels the Divine Presence (Arachin 15b). How can vanity ever have a positive application?/\r\nWe can see, however, that even vanity can have a redeeming feature. Before making a negative comment about someone, do not be humble and think of yourself as an insignificant person whose words will not be heeded. This is the time when vanity can temporarily be put to good use. “I must be careful of what I say. People are not likely to dismiss my words lightly. I am an important person, and my words can have a great impact.”/\r\n\r\nThe greater a Torah scholar a person is, the more he must be careful of his speech. The words of an esteemed Torah scholar will be taken seriously. If he speaks negatively about someone, he has allowed his Torah scholarship to become a negative force. The Midrash says that lashon hara destroys three people: the speaker, the listener and the one about whom it is spoken (Devarim Rabbah 5:10). If Torah scholarship gives credibility to one\'s lashon hara, it indeed becomes “a deadly poison.”/\r\n\r\nThe man who was peddling the “elixir of life” was not an unlearned person. He was trying to teach people mussar, personal growth. He did not believe that a great Torah scholar like R\' Yannai was in need of his teaching. When he told R\' Yannai that his teaching about lashon hara was not relevant for Torah scholars, R\' Yannai remarked, “I was unaware that people had this mistaken impression. To the contrary, it is those who are Torah scholars who have great need for this elixir of life, because Torah has value only if one is virtuous. Negligence on the part of a Torah scholar, particularly in speaking lashon hara, can seriously distort the value of Torah.”/\r\nWe can be spared from lashon hara if we incorporate the second half of the verse, “loves days that he may see good.” In his introductory morning prayer, R\' Elimelech of Lizhensk says, “Help us to see the good in our fellows, and not their defects.”/\r\n\r\nIf we concentrate on looking for the good in people, we will have no need to make negative comments about anyone.'),
(32, 28, '“Even when they are in a state of contamination, the Divine Presence is with them” (Yoma 57a)./\r\n\r\nAlthough disobeying the Divine will sets up a barrier between man and God, it is somewhat like a one-way mirror. We cause ourselves to be distant from God, but He is never distant from us. This is rather easy to understand. We sometimes see children who reject their parents, but regardless of how defiant the child may be, the parents\' love for him is as intense as ever, and they long for his return to them./\r\n\r\nWhen R\' Mendel of Kotzk first joined the court of R\' Simchah Bunim of P\'shis\'che, the latter asked him, “Young man, where is God?” R\' Mendel answered, “The entire world is full of His glory.” R\' Simchah Bunim repeated, “Young man, I asked you, where is God?” R\' Mendel answered, “There is no place that is devoid of Him.” R\' Simchah Bunim persisted, “Young man, I am asking you, where is God?” R\' Mendel said, “If my answers do not satisfy you, then you tell me.” R\' Simchah Bunim said, “God can be found wherever He is welcomed.”/\r\n\r\n“He who is haughty of eye and large of desire, him I cannot tolerate” (Psalms 101:5). Of a vain and arrogant person the Talmud quotes God as saying, “He and I cannot share the same dwelling” (Arachin 15b). God is indeed everywhere, but He withdraws His presence from a vain and arrogant person./\r\n\r\nCommitting a sin is not necessarily a denial or rejection of God. A person may simply have been overwhelmed by an urge that he did not suppress, or may not have realized that a sin causes him to be distant from God. However, a vain, egotistical person is one who is his own god. Inasmuch as there cannot be two gods, if a person thinks himself to be god, he cannot believe in the true God. There is no form of idolatry as absolute as the person who worships himself./\r\n\r\nIn my writings on self-esteem, I suggested that vanity and conceit are desperate defenses whereby a person tries to cope with a sense of unworthiness. I was thrilled to find that no less an authority than Rabbeinu Yonah validates this concept. “The vain person seeks to compensate for his feeling of defectiveness by means of grandiosity” (Rabbeinu Yonah al HaTorah, p. 156). A person with healthy self-esteem does not seek the praise and recognition of others to remind him that he has value./\r\n\r\nIf a person truly believes that he possesses a Divine neshama, soul, he will realize that he has great worth, and even if he may have gone astray in his behavior, he is nevertheless worthy by virtue of his Divine neshama. Anyone with a profound feeling of unworthiness must be in denial that he has within himself the breath of God./\r\n\r\nMan\'s closeness to God is by virtue of his soul, which craves to be united with its Source. Denial of having a Divine neshama precludes a close relationship with God./\r\n\r\nGod is with us even if we have sinned. As long as we feel a desire to be close to God, we know ourselves to be of His essence, and that we are capable of becoming more spiritual. This opens the door to teshuvah, repentance, and this is why the above verse is contained in the narrative of the Yom Kippur service.');

It is possible that “contains the greater part of the body of Torah” refers to the above verse. Indeed, Rabbi Akiva said that this verse is “the all-encompassing principle of Torah” (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 9:4)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Akiva\'s statement is sometimes translated as, “This verse is the cardinal or primary rule of Torah.” This is an inaccurate translation. Rabbi Akiva\'s words are that this is a klal gadol, which means “a great, all-encompassing principle” of Torah, and this has a broad implication./\r\n\r\nA klal is a general principle under which there are many pratim (specifics). Each specific item must have the characteristic of the klal. If any specific item does not have the characteristic of the klal, then it does not belong there. For example, “animate objects” is a klal. A rock lacks the characteristic of animation, hence it cannot be classified under that klal./\r\n\r\nOne of the ethicists said that inasmuch as “You shall love your fellow as yourself” is the “great klal” of Torah, this means that it encompasses all 613 mitzvot, and that each mitzvah must partake of the characteristic of the klal. Every mitzvah must relate to ahavat Yisrael (love for a fellow Jew), and must contribute to ahavat Yisrael. Therefore, he concludes, if a person does not have an increase in ahavat Yisrael after the performance of a mitzvah, that mitzvah was not done properly. A properly performed mitzvah must contribute to ahavat Yisrael./\r\n\r\nThis statement was nothing less than shocking. I had considered some mitzvot I had done as being properly performed. My tefillin are top quality, and there were at least some times when I had proper kavannah (concentration). The matzah I ate at the seder was of the highest quality shmurah (supervision). The sounding of the shofar that I heard on Rosh Hashanah was without fault, and the esrog (citron) that I used for the mitzvah of the four species on Sukkot was free of the slightest blemish. I felt I had fulfilled these mitzvot properly. But I must confess that I did not feel an increase in ahavat Yisrael after these mitzvot. The argument that R\' Akiva\'s klal necessitates ahavat Yisrael as an ingredient in every mitzvah is unassailable. Where was I lacking?/\r\n\r\nIt then occurred to me that I was overlooking something I say in davening every day. Is it not tragic that we may verbalize without thinking about what we are saying?/\r\n\r\nPrior to the opening prayer, Baruch She\'amar, there is a short Kabbalistic declaration of intent that includes the phrase, “I pray in the name of all Israel.” This is not the same as praying for Israel, which we do abundantly in the Amidah and other prayers. Rather, this is a declaration of intent that I am not praying alone, but that I wish to share my prayer with all Israel. Whatever merits accrue from my prayer are not exclusively mine, but belong to all Israel./\r\n\r\nI found this same declaration of intent preceding the mitzvot of putting on the tallis and tefillin and the Counting of the Omer. Further research revealed that it is recommended that this declaration is recited prior to every mitzvah one performs./\r\n\r\nIf there were true unity among Jews, this declaration would not be necessary. Just as the mitzvah of shofar accrues to the entire person rather than just to the ear, so would the mitzvah of every Jew accrue to the credit of all Jews if they were united as one body. Alas, that highly desirable state does not exist, so we must make a declaration that we wish to share the mitzvah with all of Israel. Of course, all of Israel means without exception, and indeed, ahavat Yisrael should be without exception./\r\n\r\nR\' Eliyahu Dessler says that there is a common misconception that you give to whomever you love. The reverse is true: you love to whomever you give. When you give to someone, you invest part of yourself in him, and since every person loves himself, you now love that part of you that resides in the other person (Michtav MeEliyahu vol. 1 p. 36)./\r\nIf we listen to the words we say and are sincere, then we can fulfill R\' Akiva\'s principle. By sharing our mitzvos with others, we can generate love for fellow Jews.'),
(34, 30, 'Toward the end of Parshat Emor we are presented with a description of the various holidays spanning the Jewish calendar. The seventh month – what we now call Tishrei – is jam-packed with holidays, starting with Rosh Hashanah, continuing with Yom Kippur, and culminating in Sukkot and Shemini Atzeret./\r\n\r\nAfter describing the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in great detail, Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch summarizes their essence as a buildup and counterpoint to the holiday of Sukkot. Both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of seriousness and somberness, permeated by negative emotions. Rosh Hashanah is a “a day of Teruah, a day of shatteringly shaking us up out of ways of life displeasing to God” and Yom Kippur makes us “appear before God, ‘poor’ in every justification for further living and working” (Judaica Press translation). In stark contrast, on Sukkot we celebrate by “taking of the produce of the earth to gain the joy of living and working in happiness before God.”/\r\n\r\nRabbi Hirsch then adds one simple, yet powerful, observation. Both Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are one day each, yet Sukkot is comprised of seven days. The lesson he gleans from this straightforward calculation is that the Torah is prescribing what our baseline mood should be throughout the year. It shouldn’t be the “bowed down broken feeling” associated with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but the “happy joy of life” experienced while living “a life faithfully devoted to duty,” symbolized by the seven days of Sukkot./\r\n\r\nIf our status quo mood should be one of happiness, the challenge becomes, how do we work on getting to such a state?/\r\n\r\nThere is an entire field called positive psychology dedicated to the study of happiness and well-being. One important observation that several psychologists have made is that relentlessly pursuing happiness usually does not lead to happiness. Moreover, unless we learn how to understand and accept our negative emotions, we will also not likely find lasting happiness. Healthy negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, concern, guilt, and embarrassment serve functional value. If we try and suppress these negative emotions because they make us feel uncomfortable and we want to be happy, the less likely it is that we will actually be happy./\r\n\r\nPerhaps this idea is subtly hinted at within Rabbi Hirsch’s comments as well. While our operating status quo to strive for is to serve God through happiness, we must also make time and psychological space for those more negative emotions. There is an important place for the “bowed down broken feeling” symbolized by Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and that must be experienced, if we want to build toward the happiness of Sukkot. Our pursuit of serving God with joy needs to incorporate a healthy expression of negative emotions, as well./\r\n\r\nThis may also be reflected in another aspect of the Jewish calendar mentioned in Parshat Emor, one that we are in the midst of currently, namely, the counting of the Omer. The counting is supposed to be “temimiot,” meaning whole or complete. While wholeness in this context has a serial connotation to it, in the sense that we shouldn’t miss a day, wholeness here can also hint at the concept of wholeness of personality. On the one hand, the counting of the Omer represents an exciting build up and progression, whether agriculturally or as a preparation for the giving of the Torah. On the other hand, it is a time (on a rabbinic level) of mourning and solemnness. Perhaps the “wholeness” of this time requires us to validate and experience both the positive and negative emotions simultaneously. With this, we serve God with our whole selves and it is within this wholeness we can truly experience psychological and spiritual flourishing.'),
(35, 31, 'One of the most prominent citizens of Pressburg came to Rabbi Moshe Schreiber (Chasam Sofer) and asked for a private audience. He burst into tears and told the rabbi that although he had always been a successful businessman, he had recently suffered unexpected losses and was on the verge of bankruptcy./\r\n\r\n“As soon as I default on my first loan, the word will get out and I will be ruined. Furthermore, I have never missed a trip to the marketplace in Leipzig, which is coming up shortly. If I don\'t go to Leipzig, people will suspect that something is wrong. I don\'t even have enough money for the trip,” he said./\r\n\r\n\"What are the expenses of a trip to Leipzig?” Rabbi Schreiber asked./\r\n\r\n“I used to travel in luxury,” he said. “I cannot even think of that. Just to get there and have accommodations would cost one hundred gulden.”/\r\n\r\n“One hundred gulden, is that all?” Rabbi Schreiber asked. He opened his drawer and took out the money that comprised his entire savings. “I will lend you one hundred gulden. Go to Leipzig and may God bless you with success.”/\r\n \r\n\r\nThe man refused to take the money. “I didn\'t come to you for money,” he said, “but just to unburden myself of my distress.”\r\n\r\nRabbi Schreiber insisted, however, that he take the money./\r\n\r\nAt Leipzig, the man met a merchant who suggested that he buy a huge amount of coffee, and knowing him to be a prosperous businessman, he sold it to him on credit. The next day there was a sizeable increase in the price of coffee and he sold it at a large profit. He made several other transactions which were very profitable, and was convinced that the Chasam Sofer\'s blessing had brought him this good fortune./\r\n\r\n“I must bring the rabbi a gift,” he said. Knowing that Rabbi Schreiber was an expert on diamonds, he bought a diamond ring./\r\n\r\nOn returning to Pressburg he returned the hundred gulden and gave the rabbi the ring. The rabbi admired the ring. “It is indeed a beautiful diamond,” he said. He continued to examine the ring, repeatedly praising its beauty, its color, its purity. He then gave the ring to the merchant, saying, “It is a very beautiful ring. Use it in good health.”/\r\n\r\n“But I brought the ring for you, rabbi,” the merchant said. “It was only by virtue of your blessing that I had this extraordinary success.”/\r\n\r\nThe Chasam Sofer said, “Had I not lent you the money, I might have accepted the gift. However, inasmuch as I lent you the money, taking anything more than what I lent you might constitute taking interest.”/\r\n\r\nAfter the merchant left, one of the Chasam Sofer\'s students asked him, “Why were you so lavish in praising the ring?”/\r\n\r\nThe Chasam Sofer answered, “Businessmen lend money, and they have the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of not lending on interest, as the Torah says, \'If your brother becomes impoverished and his means falter… you shall strengthen him… Do not take from him interest and increase\' (Vayikra 25:35-36). As a rabbi, when do I have the opportunity to fulfill this mitzvah? No one comes to me for a loan. Here I was presented with the unusual opportunity to fulfill this mitzvah by refusing the ring. The ring was a vehicle whereby I could fulfill this mitzvah by returning it. How could I not praise something that enabled me to fulfill a mitzvah?\"/\r\n\r\nWe are blessed with the opportunity to do mitzvot. We should cherish these precious opportunities.'),
(36, 32, '“If you will walk in My decrees and observe My commandments and perform them” (Vayikra 26:3)./\r\n\r\nR\' Simchah Bunim of P\'shis\'che pointed out that whereas the heavenly angels do not progress in holiness and remain forever in the state in which they were created, man should not remain static, but advance in spirituality every day of his life. This is what the prophet means: “If you walk in My ways and safeguard My charge I shall permit you movement among these immobile [angels]” (Zechariah 3:7)./\r\n\r\nGod has enabled us to have “movement,” i.e., to grow in spirituality in contrast to angels that remain stationary./\r\n\r\nR\' Saadiah Gaon once lodged at an inn, and because the innkeeper did not know his identity, he was not accorded the honor due him but was treated decently like any other customer. Someone who did recognize him informed the innkeeper who his guest was. The innkeeper then apologized profusely to the Gaon./\r\n\r\n\"Why are you apologizing?” the Gaon asked. “You treated me very well.”/\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper said, “But if I had only known who you were, I would have served you with greater respect.”/\r\n\r\nThe Gaon became tearful. “Today I have a better understanding of God than I had yesterday. If only I had known yesterday what I know today, I would have served God with much greater fervor.”/\r\n\r\nLet us be truthful with ourselves. Have we progressed spiritually in the last day? Is every day of our lives one of spiritual advancement? If not, then we are derelict in our roles as human beings. We do have the capacity to grow spiritually, and it is wrong to not do so./\r\n\r\nThe fact is that there is no standing in one place. If we are derelict in advancing ourselves spiritually, this failure sets us back and we regress spiritually. We are constantly in movement. If we do not move forward, we are slipping backward./\r\n\r\nThe wording of the Torah is precise. It is not enough to simply observe the mitzvot. We must do so in a way that we progress in spirituality.'),
(37, 33, 'Muzafer Sherif was a Turkish born psychologist who moved to the United States for graduate school and moved back to Turkey in the 1930’s to teach in Ankara University. He was imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement for criticizing the Nazi party and the Turkish government. He subsequently moved back to America, becoming a pioneering social psychologist./\r\n\r\nHe is known for one of the most famous experiments related to intergroup conflicts and resolutions. Sherif gathered 22 boys in Robbers Cave State Park in Oklahoma and divided them into two groups – the Eagles and the Rattlers. At first, the two groups did not interact with each other and naturally built their own group cohesion. In the second stage of the experiment, the two groups were placed in situations where they would have to compete for various rewards and resources. Consequently, hostility between the groups increased, engendering hatred and creating conflicts./\r\n\r\nFinally, the groups were made to interact without competition, but this itself did not decrease the conflict. Tensions decreased and intergroup cohesion was created only after the two groups were made to work together towards a mutual goal that required them to cooperate (termed a superordinate goal)./\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this week\'s Torah portion delineates the details of a census that God commanded Moses to take of the Jewish males over the age of twenty. The numbers presented are divided by the different tribes and the specific formation that the tribes took in the desert is described as well. The first verse communicates the exact date that God spoke to Moses, namely, the first day of the second month of the second year after they were taken out of Egypt. Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky asks, why is that they waited until the second year to take this census and create the tribal formations? Wouldn’t it have made more sense to do this in the first year?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Kamenetsky explains that there is a danger inherent in the tribalism that is presented in this week\'s Torah portion. Separating by groups and standing behind flags creates an us-versus-them mentality. When people stand in groups behind their own flags, they will favor their own group and be hostile to the other groups. One way to overcome this natural human tendency is to create a unifying, superordinate goal. In our case, that is the function of the Torah. Only with the Torah in the center can we attempt to create a healthy, cooperative group dynamic. Only with the mishkan, the tabernacle, in the center of the formation could the tribes march around in their own group./\r\n\r\nThis is why God waited until the second year, after the Torah was given and after the mishkan became the epicenter. Only then was the danger of having different tribes mitigated./\r\n\r\nThis tension between the in-group and the out-group is highlighted by Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch as well. Introducing the census (Numbers, 1:1-2), God tells Moses to count the heads of the entire congregation of Israel (adat Bnei Yisrael) according to their families (lemishpechotam) and the house of their fathers (le-beit avotam). Rabbi Hirsch argues that adat Bnei Yisrael represents the unified whole of the people in the desert. However, there is a second aspect, focusing on the families and the households. This second part represents the individual differences between families and tribes. This diversity and uniqueness is important, but can be dangerous if not expressed within the context of a unified whole./\r\n\r\nAs we prepare for Shavuot, may we merit finding our own unique voices and contributions to the Jewish people, while not allowing these differences to create divisiveness. This can be accomplished if our focal point is serving God, not ourselves or our groups, and then we can stand unified in heart and mind as we accept the Torah.'),
(38, 34, 'The struggle for self-control is one of the most important, hardest-fought battles of all time. Unfortunately, there are many casualties, and our will often loses to temptation. To become a nazir, we are told in this week\'s Torah portion, one must take a vow, which commits one to abstain from grape products, from defiling oneself to a human corpse and from having one’s haircut./\r\n\r\nThe verse uses a strange word to describe the act of vowing, namely, yafli. Ibn Ezra presents two possibilities as to what the word could mean. The first is that it connotes setting oneself apart (yafrish). The second is that it means wonder (pelah). Most people just give into their temptation. The nazir’s commitment to self-control, Ibn Ezra argues, is so rare and powerful as to be called wondrous. On the one hand, the Nazir inspires us to have more self-control, and on the other, reminds us that most people fail, or even worse, don’t even try./\r\n\r\nThe topic that immediately precedes that of nazir is that of the sotah. A woman whose husband warns her in front of witnesses not to seclude herself with another man, and she does so anyways, must go through the sotah ceremony to determine whether she committed adultery. Intrigued by the juxtaposition of these two otherwise seemingly different concepts, the Midrash proposes a connection. Nazir comes after sotah because anyone who witnesses the downfall of the sotah will be so dedicated to avoiding such demise, that he or she will commit to not drinking any wine out of fear that wine could lead to adultery./\r\n\r\nThe connection the Midrash is making between nazir and sotah is not tangential or coincidental. It is revealing the core message behind both concepts. The ideal way to deal with temptations, both the mitzvah of sotah and the mitzvah of nazir are telling us, is by avoiding the battle in the first place. To avoid becoming a sotah, don’t put yourself in an environment that is conducive to sin. This includes not drinking wine as well as avoiding situations of seclusion that are more primed for temptation./\r\n\r\nAlong comes the section about nazir and the idea becomes intensified. Usually the Sages are responsible for implementing additional restrictions as fences and barriers to protect Biblical commandments but the case of the nazir is one of the few examples where the Torah itself provides added restrictions serving to protect the original law. Don’t just avoid wine, but avoid any grape products. Don’t just avoid grape products, but avoid even approaching a vineyard!/\r\n\r\nIn a 2016 article entitled “Situational Strategies for Self-Control,” Dr. Angela Duckworth argues that situational strategies are the most salient and effective ones to avoid self-control failures, yet they are also the most underappreciated and underutilized. We often take the battle against temptation head on and eventually lose to that delicious looking piece of chocolate cake. We think we will be able to study, but become powerless to avoid the allure of our phones./\r\n\r\nThe smartest and most effective strategy is to not buy the chocolate cake in the first place and to leave our phone off when we want to focus./\r\n\r\nYes, the struggle for self-control is a difficult one, but perhaps we are going about it all wrong. Fighting a head-to-head battle between willpower and temptation is only a last resort. Many have fallen in the heat of passion or the intenseness of an emotion. The better way, learning from the sotah’s mistakes and taking the lead from the Nazir, is to avoid the battle in the first place. Avoid temptations and situations that could lead to sin. In so doing, perhaps we can have better luck in succeeding in our self-control goals and become happier, healthier, and more spiritually refined people.'),
(39, 35, 'Research on the “variety effect” proves what most of us know after partaking of a smorgasbord. People tend to eat more when there are more options. When the color, flavor, or shape of a food is varied we ingest more than we do if there is just one choice. By satiating a range of sensory experiences, we are able to fulfill more desires with increased consumption. Perhaps unsurprisingly, variety related eating habits are linked to obesity./\r\n\r\nAfter over a year of consuming the manna, the Children of Israel had enough. Yes, it looked nice and tasted good, but food falling from the Heavens was not enough to prevent complaining. They wanted meat. They remembered with fondness the fish they ate in Egypt chinam (for free), as well as the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. Yet upon analysis, we are left wondering. Are cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic really that superior to the manna? Was the food in Egypt really that free and easy to come by that it beat the convenience of food falling from the sky?/\r\n\r\nThe Midrash, cited by Rashi, is convinced that there is a deeper motivation behind the complaint. The Children of Israel couldn’t be longing for the free food in Egypt, because according to the Midrash, there was no free food in Egypt. The Egyptians made them work tirelessly to find their own straw in order to make their own bricks – the Egyptians weren’t exactly in the business of handing out free food. Rather, underneath the Children of Israel\'s complaints, either consciously or subconsciously, was a more serious protest. They missed not the free food, but the freedom from restraints. In Egypt they were free from mitzvot, and now they were constrained with rules and regulations./\r\n\r\nUnlike the Midrash, Ramban understands chinam (free) at face value. In Egypt, he suggests, they did have ease of access to food. If they worked by the river, they were allowed to catch and eat fish. If they worked in the fields, there was such an abundance, that the field owners allowed the Children of Israel to eat what they liked as they gathered the crops. Yes, they had to work, but they could eat whenever they wanted because it was so plentiful and available. Manna was also free financially, but it was not as free from restrictions. With the manna, the Children of Israel could only get a controlled portion within a specific schedule. The Meshech Chochma points out that they even had meat available to eat, but the only way to eat it was to bring it to the Ohel Moed, the Tent of Meeting. There was plenty of free food, but there were also restrictions./\r\n\r\nPerhaps an additional part of the complaint is tied to the monotony of the manna. It was the same food, every day. The nostalgia of cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic is not about taste, but variety. On a similar level, the Netziv proposes that the foods they requested represent different courses. Instead of just having one course of manna, the Children of Israel wanted appetizers, dips, and dessert to go along with it./\r\n\r\nGod was trying to teach them controlled, scheduled, spiritually-motivated eating. The Children of Israel rebelled and complained because they desired the unbounded, unrestricted, smorgasbord variety of eating that they were used to from Egypt. In our own lives, whether in the context of food or otherwise, we may have a natural desire for variety and freedom from constraints. Yet, the message of the manna and the aftermath of the complaint is that it is beneficial to curb this craving. In so doing, may we merit living more psychologically, physically, and spiritually healthy lives.'),
(40, 36, 'There is a small, yet growing subfield within psychology called color psychology. Researchers in this field are interested in how people perceive, relate to, and respond differently to various colors. Some reactions that we have to colors may be based on biology. For instance, since blood rushes to the face when one becomes aggressive, the color red, in both humans and animals, is a signal of dominance. Other reactions to colors may be based on a learned association between the color and another object. For instance, a Yankee fan may feel happy when seeing blue pinstripes because he or she associates that color scheme with the team./\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this week\'s Torah portion we are informed of the mitzvah of tzitzit. We are commanded to place fringes on our garments, including a thread that is tekhelet. The purpose of doing so is stated explicitly within the verses, as they function to remind us of God’s commandments and not to wander after our hearts and eyes. Later authorities debate the exact color of tekhelet. Some say it is blue, some violet, and some green. Others debate how many strings have to be tekhlet and how many are to be white./\r\n\r\nHow exactly does wearing fringed garments remind us of the mitzvot and prevent us from wandering after our hearts and eyes? Numerous explanations have been given, some focusing on number symbolism, others on the significance of garments, and still others on the importance of color. Focusing for now on this last category, the question becomes more specific: how does wearing blue/violet/green strings interspersed through white strings, remind us not to sin?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Meir (Menachot 43b) tells us that looking at tekhelet sets off a string of associations that keeps us from sinning. Tekhelet, which he seems to understand as being blue, is a similar color to the ocean, which is a similar color to the sky, which is a similar color to G-d’s Throne of Glory. Ramban adds that within the word tekhelet are the words kol (all) and tachlit (purpose). Meaning at its core tekhelet reminds us of our mission in this world, which is to serve God by doing mitzvot and avoid sinning./\r\n\r\nWriting in the 15th century, Rabbi Isaac Arama suggests that there is another important moral significance embedded within tekhelet. The message is dependent on a medieval color theory which is not followed in modern times. The assumption was that there were seven colors that flowed on a spectrum: white, yellow, red, green, blue, purple and black. At the extremes of the spectrum were white and black, and sitting in the middle was green. Rabbi Arama, presumably understanding that tekhelet is green, argues that the symbolism behind tekhelet is that it is the middle ground between extremes. This serves as a model for our character traits that we should follow the middle path./\r\n\r\nUsing Rabbi Arama’s precedent to interpret the message of tekhelet based on the color science of his time, perhaps there is another layer to tekhelet that we can add by viewing it through the prism of modern color psychology. In a fascinating article researching how colors impact marketing strategy, Lauren Labrecque and George Milne summarize previous findings as to the psychological significance of different colors. White, the total reflection of all of the colors, is associated with sincerity, purity, and peace. Blue, which along with violet represent the shortest wavelength of all of the colors, is associated with intelligence, trust, and duty. In contrast, colors on the longer end of the wavelength spectrum (like red, orange, and yellow) stimulate states of excitement and arousal, oftentimes emotions related to sin./\r\n\r\nAs the verses indicate, tzitzit function to counteract sin. Presupposing that tekhelet is blue, perhaps the duty and loyalty invoked by seeing blue and the purity associated with white, are meant as a counter to calm the excitement represented by the red of sin. In addition to the associations that lead to us to think of God’s throne, the psychological symbolism of the colors themselves may serve as an intervention to arrest the arousal of sin and remind us to be loyal to God.'),
(41, 37, 'When one reads the account of Korach\'s rebellion (Numbers 16:1-35), one is astounded by the incident. Not only was Moses the one who led the Jews from Egypt, but all the Israelites were eyewitnesses to the many miracles that were wrought through him. They saw him wave his staff over the Reed Sea, causing the waters to divide. There could be no doubt that he was commissioned by God to be the leader. How could anyone question the authenticity of Moses\' leadership? It simply defies all logic./\r\n\r\nRashi quotes the Midrash which raises this question: How could Korach, a wise and learned person, act so foolishly? The Midrash answers that Moses had appointed another Levite to be leader of the tribe of Levi, and Korach was envious of this./\r\n\r\nYet, this does not fully answer the question. Can envy so deprive a person of logical thinking that one would deny the evidence of one\'s own eyes?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Chaim Shmulevitz (Sichos Mussar 5731:21) helps us understand this. He cites the Talmudic statement, “Envy, lust and pursuit of acclaim remove a person from the world” (Ethics of the Fathers 4:28). The expression “remove a person from the world” is rather strange. Rabbi Shmulevitz explains that the usual deviation from proper behavior is a very gradual one. The Talmud says that the tactic of the yetzer hara, the evil inclination, is to seduce a person to commit a very minor infraction, then lead him on to progressively more serious transgressions (Shabbos 108b). That is the nature and order of the world. The yetzer hara will not entice a person into doing something patently absurd./\r\n\r\nHowever, if a person is overtaken by envy, one escapes the natural order of the world. One is no longer bound by logic. The passion of envy can be so great that it can overwhelm all rational thought, and leave one vulnerable to the yetzer hara\'s seduction to behave in the most irrational manner. Envy indeed removes a person from the natural order of the world./\r\n\r\nThat is what happened with Korach. Moses understood this, and delayed the trial until the next day (see Rashi to Numbers 16:5)./\r\n\r\nThe Korach episode conveys a most important teaching. We are all vulnerable to envy, and envy is not a difficult emotion to identify. If you feel yourself being envious, do nothing for a while. Envy can suspend all logical thinking and make one do things that one will regret./\r\n\r\nIf you feel envious, ventilate your feelings to a friend or write them down. Read one of the ethical works about envy. This will help you realize that envy is a futile and destructive feeling. Before doing anything foolish that may be a reaction to your envy, seek the counsel of a friend or mentor. You may avoid making serious mistakes.'),
(42, 38, '\"The Torah relates the wars between Moab and the Amorites, and says, Regarding this the poets would say: \'Come to Heshbon – let it be built and established as the city of Sihon\'” (Bamidbar, 21:27)./\r\n\r\nThe word that the Torah uses for “poet,” moshel, also means “ruler.” The word Heshbon is the Hebrew word for “accounting.” The Talmud, therefore, offers this interpretation of the above verse: “Those who rule over themselves can make an accounting, calculating the gains and losses in life: the gain of a mitzvah as opposed to its cost, and the cost of a sin as opposed to its gain” (Bava Basra 78b)./\r\n\r\nMuch of western civilization lives under the influence of “seizing the pleasure of the moment.” The American economy is built upon credit, with people being urged to “buy now, pay later.” If people would calculate the ultimate cost of credit purchases which may be outrageous, they might delay buying things until they can afford to pay for them. But persistent and impressive advertising seduces people to get what they want, and to get it now. Blinded by their desires, people do not calculate./\r\n\r\nHow many people who know the long-term danger of smoking render themselves oblivious to it because the desire for the immediate effects of smoking overwhelms their rational thought? The Talmud\'s statement is correct. Only “those who rule over themselves,” who are not enslaved by their physical desires, can be objective and make an accurate accounting of the positives and negatives in life choices./\r\n\r\nAnimals do not “choose.” They follow their instincts and do whatever is most pleasing. They are not rulers over their lives, but merely slaves to their physical drives which they cannot resist. Human beings should take pride in being rulers. Allowing oneself to be governed by physical drives is essentially an abdication of one\'s humanity./\r\n\r\nOnce a person can be a “ruler” one can calculate “the gain of a mitzvah as opposed to its cost, and the cost of a sin as opposed to its gain.” I would like to share an example of this with you./\r\n\r\nDue to my extensive work in treating alcoholism and drug addiction I have been immersed among people whose entire life is focused on getting a momentary thrill for which they must pay dearly in the long run. Their addiction to chemicals has taken every vestige of self-rule from them./\r\n\r\nAvi is one such person. He is an Israeli whose pursuit of the “high” of drugs led him to a career of crime. His convictions for burglary resulted in eight imprisonments for a total of sixteen of his thirty-four years. This was certainly a long-term loss for a momentary “high,” but Avi had no self-rule. He lived under the tyranny of drug addiction./\r\n\r\nAfter Avi underwent a successful rehabilitation, he once found an envelope with 5,000 shekels. This was ostensibly hefker (ownerless) money, which the finder has a right to keep. It just so happened that Avi knew to whom it belonged, and he returned it. What a turnaround, from burglarizing homes to returning lost money to its owner! Avi had attained self-rule./\r\n\r\nI learned about this incident and congratulated Avi on his great progress. Avi said, “In the days when I used drugs, I would get a high that lasted for perhaps 20 minutes. When it wore off, I felt worse than ever. The incident when I returned the money happened six months ago. Whenever I think of it, I still get a good feeling.”/\r\n\r\nWhen he was enslaved by his addiction, Avi could not calculate the long-term cost he would have to pay for a fleeting pleasure. As a “ruler,” Avi was able to make an accounting, to calculate the loss of 5,000 shekels which he could have kept as opposed to the good feeling of doing a mitzvah, which persisted for six months and would be with him forever./\r\n\r\nWe should become rulers over ourselves. Only then can we make an honest calculation, gaining the most out of life and avoiding severe losses.'),
(43, 39, 'He perceived no iniquity in Jacob, and saw no perversity in Israel” (Bamidbar, 23:21)./\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word amal, translated here as “perversity,” has a second meaning, “toil.” It is an expression for work, especially laborious and exhausting work. The Ohr HaChaim uses this translation to give a unique interpretation to Balaam\'s words: “He saw no exhaustion in Israel.” Balaam perceived that even when Israel devotes itself wholeheartedly to the observance of Torah and mitzvot, it does not exhaust them./\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that when someone has an overwhelming desire for something, he may be tireless in its pursuit. We have numerous accounts of the indefatigable study of Torah of our great scholars. It was not unusual for them to study Torah for eighteen hours each day./\r\n\r\nThe prophet says, “You did not call upon Me, Jacob, because you became weary of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). The Maggid of Dubno explained this verse with a parable:/\r\n\r\nA merchant alighted from a ship and hired a porter to deliver his merchandise to his home. When the porter knocked at his door, sweating profusely and breathing heavily, the merchant promptly said, “Those were not my packages that you brought!”/\r\n\r\nThe porter asked, “You haven\'t even seen what I brought. How can you say they\'re not yours?”/\r\n\r\n“Because,” the merchant said, “I deal in jewelry. My packages are light. They never would have caused you to sweat profusely.”/\r\n\r\nThe Maggid said, “This is the thought that the prophet is conveying. God says, `How do I know that you are not calling upon Me? Because you become weary and exhausted with your praying. You may be just going through the motions of prayer. Praying to Me would not cause you to be fatigued.\' ”/\r\n\r\nOur devotion in prayer, our passion for Torah and our love for mitzvot should be such that we never tire in their performance.'),
(44, 40, 'After processing the news that he will not be leading Bnei Yisrael into the land of Canaan due to his and Aharon’s sin at Mei Meriva, Moshe turns to God and asks Him to appoint a successor. In his dialogue with God, Moshe addresses Him with a strange appellation – Elokei HaRuchot – God of Spirits. Two verses later, God tells Moshe to take Yehoshua, a man who has “ruach” and appoint him as the leader. The role of ruach is clearly essential in the narrative, but it is unclear exactly what it is and why it is so important./\r\n\r\nDepending on the context, the term ruach can mean several things in Tanach, including wind, breath, spirit, feelings, or will. Rashi understands the term here as a reference to people’s general personality. God is a God of ruach, meaning that the personality of every individual is revealed before Him. He should appoint a leader who will be able to tolerate each person based on his or her own inner makeup. Yehoshua is a man who has ruach, meaning he can conduct himself in a manner that would correspond to every individual./\r\n\r\nRashi’s description of the skills required to lead is striking on two fronts. The first, is the care and concern the leader must have for ALL of his or her followers. Rashi emphasizes the importance of understanding the innumerable differences between each individual and the duty to adapt accordingly. The leader doesn’t just make policy for the masses and let some fall through the cracks. He or she needs to tend to everyone./\r\n\r\nThe second is the seeming parallel to the constructs of social and emotional intelligence. Broadly speaking, emotional intelligence incorporates the ability to read and manage emotions both in the self and others. Social intelligence encompasses verbal and listening skills, a depth of understanding of social situations, and the capacity to insert oneself effectively in those contexts. Rashi’s description of ruach highlights the need to understand the depths of personality of the other and manage the self and others accordingly. Research in educational psychology as well as in industrial and organizational psychology demonstrates how important these skills are for leaders and educators -- but the question becomes, how does one attain these abilities?/\r\n\r\nOne answer is that having this ruach is simply a gift from God. I either have it or I don’t. All I can do is daven and hope that Hashem grants me these abilities. In fact, we find precedent for such a notion when Hashem took some of Moshe’s ruach and placed it upon the elders until they absorbed it (Bemidbar 11:17)./\r\n\r\nHowever, the Alshich points out, this is not the same procedure that happens with Yehoshua. Yehoshua apparently already had these traits so he did not need a Divine intervention to provide them. That’s why, according to Abarbanel, God tells Moshe in reference to Yehoshua: “kach lecha” – you take – as if to say, don’t turn to me to appoint him and make him ready for leadership. Yehoshua already has the skills because he spent years observing Moshe’s behavior and modeling his own behavior accordingly./\r\n\r\nMost of us in some form or another, whether at home, work, or school, take on a position of a leader. We learn from this narrative that we need to be a person of ruach – to care and tend to everyone we are guiding, and to attempt to understand their inner psychology using our emotional and social intelligence and deal with each one accordingly. The good news is that this is a skill that can be taught and learned, which makes it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources if we want to develop into more effective leaders.'),
(45, 41, 'Having conquered Transjordan en route to Canaan, the tribes of Gad and Reuben approached Moses. “The land that God smote before the assembly of Israel it is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock... let this land be given to your servants as a heritage; do not bring us across the Jordan” (Deut. 32:4-5)./\r\n\r\nAlthough the tribes of Gad and Reuben were foremost in the battle for Canaan, they were nevertheless guilty of rejecting their portion in Canaan in favor of the rich grazing lands in Transjordan. When the Jews were driven from the Holy Land, the tribes of Gad and Reuben were the first to be exiled. The Midrash states that this was because they had chosen Transjordan over Canaan (Bamidbar Rabbah 22)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Aharon Kotler states that the intentions of the two tribes may have seemed commendable. With abundant grazing land for their livestock, they would not have to work as hard as farmers, and they would have more time to devote to Torah study. However, the fact was that this was not their true motivation. Their decision was induced by the wealth that Transjordan would bring them, and for this they abdicated the additional mitzvot that prevailed in Canaan: bikkurim (the offering of the first fruits), the Omer, the offering of the loaves on Shavuot. And the result? Not only did they forfeit the mitzvot, but they were also the first to lose their land./\r\n\r\nThe accounts in the Torah are intended for teaching and guidance rather than history. We have so many waking hours which we allot to prayer, Torah study and work. Which of these gets the lion\'s share? Is it proper that we often make short order of our morning prayers in order to get to the office as early as possible?/\r\n\r\nThere are some traits that are innate, and others that are developed by habit. The acquisitive drive is inborn, and since it may detract us from our spiritual goals, we should seek to attenuate it. Reinforcing the acquisitive drive by habit allows it to dominate our lives. But we should realize that any monetary gain achieved at the cost of neglecting mitzvot is not likely to endure./\r\n\r\nWe would do well to rethink our priorities (Mishnas R\' Ahron p. 226).'),
(46, 42, 'In narrating the laws of the unintentional killer, the Torah says,\r\nthe assembly shall judge and the assembly shall rescue the (unintentional) killer from the hands of the avenger of blood (Deut. 35:24-25)./\r\n\r\nFrom the phrase “the assembly shall rescue,” the Talmud derives the law that the court should make every attempt to avoid imposing a death sentence. One Jewish law is remarkable: If the court (of 23 judges) renders a unanimous verdict of guilty, the case is dismissed (Sanhedrin 17a)./\r\n\r\nRabbi Shlomo Kluger explains that there is an ongoing battle between truth and falsehood. Wherever there is truth, there will arise an opposition of falsehood. Therefore, if the majority of the judges find the defendant guilty and a minority dissent, we can assume that the truth is with the majority and that the minority represent falsehood. If, however, there is a unanimous verdict of guilt, it cannot possibly be correct, for if it were a true judgement, falsehood would find some way of making an opposing statement. Therefore, there is reason to assume that a unanimous verdict of guilt is incorrect./\r\n\r\nWhen there are differences of opinion, a person can consider both sides and reach a logical conclusion. Unanimity may deprive a person of critical analysis./\r\n\r\nWe should exert caution when there is a unanimity of opinion. Few things in the world are so clear cut that there is not the slightest dissent.'),
(47, 43, 'Is courage a trait that we are born with or can it be learned and cultivated?/\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Biswas-Diener, in his book The Courage Quotient, contends based on research and experience that we can increase our levels of courage and he outlines several useful strategies. As one example, at times fear is increased by egocentrism. The more we focus on ourselves and the potential consequences that can befall us, the more we tend to be afraid. Consequently, one potential intervention to decrease fear is to promote an outward focus, rather than an inner one. The more we remove ourselves from the situation, the more potential courage we can feel./\r\n\r\nThe first topic Moses elucidates as he commences his farewell address to the Children of Israel is the laws pertaining to judges. The main thesis of the guidelines he presents is that the judges must act to promote justice and prevent corruption. In this context, the verse states, “lo taguru mipnei ish, ki hamishpat leilokim hu” – “do not ‘taguru’ before man, for judgement is God’s” (Devarim 1:17). What does the word taguru mean? Rashi presents two interpretations. The first is that the word means fear, so the verse is commanding judges not to fear other people./\r\n\r\nThe second explanation, based on the Talmud (Sanhedrin 6b), is that taguru means to hold back. The example given concerns a student observing his teacher judge a case between a rich and poor person, and the student discerns an argument for the poor person, the student should not withhold his point. Whether he is nervous about his teacher’s response or the rich man’s, he must not suppress his thought. Yet, even if this second explanation of Rashi is correct and the word literally means to hold back, the message of the verse is still about fear. Fear of another human being cannot be a factor when pursuing justice./\r\n\r\nThe commentators differ as to the meaning of the continuation of the verse, “ki hamishpat leilokim hu” – “for judgement is God’s.” Rashi, based on the Talmud (Sanhedrin 8a) explains that if a judge rules falsely, it becomes an inconvenience for God. Since God is just, He will need to \'work overtime\' to figure out a way to return the money to the rightful owner. Ramban, perhaps dissatisfied with that answer, presents a broader theological and moralistic explanation of the verse. The reason why judges cannot let fear pervert justice is because they are standing as representatives of God. They serve as God’s messengers to bring justice into the world, and if they distort the truth, they are derelict in their hallowed duty.\r\n\r\nBoth Rashi and Ramban understand that when the verse says “for judgement is God’s,” it functions as a reason for why a judge shouldn’t pervert judgement. Don’t fear man, either because you will be inconveniencing God or because you are perverting your mission from God. However, based on the idea from “The Courage Quotient” quoted above, perhaps we can suggest that the phrase does not function as a reason why judges shouldn’t fear man, but as a strategy as to how they can decrease fear of man. Meaning, the way to decrease fear is to realize that justice belongs to God. If fear of another man is increased by a focus and concern for what harm that person can cause the self, the judges should remove the focus from themselves and direct their attention to the Divine. They should increase their courage by transcending concerns of person and ego and focusing on their Divine mission./\r\n\r\nEven though the verse concerns judges, the message can be applied to each of us. There will be times when we will be confronted by a moral dilemma. When standing up and doing the right thing requires courage. When concern of what others will say or do can lead to fear and inaction. In those moments, may we find the courage by rising above our personal worries and remembering that we too can become emissaries of God’s word and will to bring justice to this world.');

(48, 44, 'In my work treating alcoholics, I have found that the greatest success for sustained abstinence from alcohol is through participation in the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of the fundamentals of this program is taking “one day at a time.” The addicted alcoholic cannot conceive never again being able to drink. Inasmuch as he has relied on alcohol to feel good, he sees a lifetime of sobriety as being completely unrealistic. There is no point in even trying to do the impossible./\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is taught a new philosophy, “Take one day at a time. There is nothing that you can do today about tomorrow\'s drinking, so there is no point in thinking about it. It is not impossible for you to stay sober just for today. That is certainly within your ability. So stay sober today, and when tomorrow comes, you can deal with its challenges then.”/\r\n\r\nOne of my friends would write down each day how many days he had been sober. When he died at age 83, it was found that the night before he had written the number 16,472. He had been sober for 46 years because he took one day at a time./\r\n\r\nThe concept of taking one day at a time was promoted by Alcoholics Anonymous, which originated in the mid 1930\'s. More than 150 years ago, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (Chasam Sofer) cited the above verse as teaching this concept./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud quotes ben Sira, “Do not agonize about tomorrow\'s problems, because you have no way of predicting tomorrow” (Sanhedrin 100b). The Chasam Sofer says that this is the way one can vanquish the yetzer hara, the lower self. If a person thinks that he must resist the yetzer hara\'s temptations throughout his entire lifetime, he might consider it impossible and may give up without trying. Therefore, Chasam Sofer says, think about resisting the yetzer hara only today. That is certainly within everyone\'s abilities./\r\n\r\nThis is what Moses told the Israelites. “You can cleave unto God and observe all His mitzvot if you think only about living this day. Don\'t take on tomorrow\'s challenges today.”/\r\n\r\nI am indebted to one of my alcoholic patients who called me, citing the verse in the Torah which says that Jacob love Rachel so intensely, that the seven years he had to wait for her seemed to him like just a few days (Genesis 29:20). He noted that some commentaries say that this is contrary to nature. Separation from someone you love makes each day seem endless, rather than the reverse./\r\n\r\n“But if you look closely at the words in the Torah,” my patient said, “the answer is obvious. The Torah says that the seven years were yamim achadim, which means single days. Jacob was able to tolerate the long separation because each day he thought, `I only have to deal with today,\' and that was doable.”/\r\n\r\nIt is standard operating procedure for people to make “New Year resolutions,” and it is common knowledge that they invariably fail. The reason is that “I will not smoke this entire year,” or “I will not eat excessively this entire year” is too great an undertaking, and one fails because one cannot conceive of succeeding. The correct thing to do is, as Chasam Sofer says, to tackle only today\'s problem today. Breaking a resolution down to bite-size pieces makes it feasible to keep./\r\nby Rabbi A.J. Twersky'),
(49, 45, '\"You will eat and you will be satisfied, and bless your God for the good Land that He gave you\" (Deut. 8:10)./\r\n\r\nIn the blessing after meals, we thank God not only for the food we ate, but also for delivering us from Egypt, for the Promised Land, for His covenant with us, for the Torah, for life and for His kindness./\r\n\r\nIf someone invited you for a meal, you would undoubtedly thank him. However, would you say, “Thank you for taking me into your house, for giving me a chair and seating me at the table?” Why, when we thank God for the food He has given us, do we enumerate all these other things?/\r\n\r\nIt is because the comparison to being invited to a meal is not accurate. A better comparison is to someone who was stranded in an arid desert and had not had any food for several days. If a truck comes by and picks him up and the driver gives him some food and water, he will thank him profusely not only for the food and water but also for stopping to pick him up and saving his life./\r\n\r\nThis, says Rabbi Benzion Bruk, is how we should feel toward God. He provides us not only with food, not only with the necessities of life, but also with life itself. We should indeed express our gratitude for all of these./\r\n\r\nOne of the chassidic masters asks, In as much as we should recite a blessing for everything we enjoy in this world, how do we listen to music or enjoy fine art without a blessing?/\r\n\r\nHe suggests that whereas the Talmud did not prescribe a blessing for everything, it is proper that the first time in a day that we recite the blessing \"shehakol nihiyeh bidvoro (Who created everything for His glory),\" we should have the intention that we wish this blessing to apply to everything for which no specific blessing was designated./\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent suggestion. We should not lose sight of the fact that everything we enjoy is a Divine gift.'),
(50, 46, '“See, I present before you today a blessing and a curse” (Deut. 11:26).\r\nR Yitzchok Meir of Gur says that God has given a person the wisdom and understanding to be able to distinguish between right and wrong, between a blessing and curse./\r\n\r\nWe have not only the intelligence to make wise decisions but also the ability to do so. Yet, we often see people making unwise decisions that are to their own detriment, and they fail to use these God-given strengths in their own favor./\r\n\r\nThis thought occurs to me when I see intelligent and even scholarly people smoking cigarettes, knowingly poisoning themselves. True, it would require effort and some tolerance of discomfort to break the habit, but certainly one\'s life is dear enough that one should willingly accept the discomfort in the interest of survival. People who readily accept the discomfort of a surgical procedure to save their lives nonetheless appear unable to do so with regard to discontinuing smoking./\r\n\r\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that one\'s judgment is distorted by what one would like to believe. The Torah states this very clearly: “A bribe will blind the eyes of the wise” (Deuteronomy 16:19). One\'s wisdom is ineffective when a bribe has affected one\'s judgment capacity. A blind person would indeed wish to avoid falling into a pit, but he cannot help himself if he cannot see it./\r\n\r\nThis is true of every unwise decision. Smoking is just one stark example. We are constantly under the influence of biases that impair our judgment.\r\n/\r\nThe blind person cannot make himself sighted, but we do have the ability to overcome the blindness of our biases. We just need to be on the alert and on the defensive, realizing our vulnerability./\r\n\r\nMoses chose his words very deliberately: “See, I present before you today a blessing and a curse.” See, indeed. You have the ability to overcome the blindness of your biases.'),
(51, 47, 'How would you rate your driving ability in comparison to everybody else? What about your intelligence? Memory? Popularity? Honesty? Personality?/\r\n\r\nResearch on the better-than-average effect demonstrates that most people rate themselves as being higher than average across a wide-range of skills, intelligence, and personality characteristics (including the ones mentioned in the above questions), even though it is statistically impossible for a majority of people to be above average in any particular area./\r\n\r\nThe theory behind these findings is that most of us have a self-enhancement bias, meaning that we are prone to interpret the world in a way that makes us feel better about ourselves, even if it is not true. We even have a bias that assumes that we are less biased than the average person!/\r\n\r\nWhile discussing related concepts in his book The Happiness Hypothesis, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt uses a metaphor of “the inner lawyer” to describe these tendencies. It is like we have an attorney inside our heads whose job it is to always defend ourselves against any possibility of fault./\r\n\r\nIn the Jewish spiritual-ethical literature, we are called upon to overcome these biased tendencies as they are detrimental to the trait of humility and disregard the values of truth and honesty. They can also negatively impact our relationship with others and with God./\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this week\'s Torah portion, Moses outlines a robust system of governance to ensure justice: “You shall set up judges and law enforcement officials for yourself in all your cities… and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment” (Deut. 16:18). Some commentators notice a superfluous word in the verse. It could have just stated to set up judges and officials in all your cities, but instead it adds the word “lecha” – for yourself. What added meaning can be deduced from emphasizing that the judges and officials are “for yourself”?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Moshe Feinstein suggests that the “for yourself” transforms the message from being one exclusively about governance and community to a personalized message about the inner life of each individual. We are all called on to be our own inner judge, to ensure that our actions are proper. We should also be our own law enforcement official to make sure that we follow through on the proper course of action./\r\n\r\nThe subsequent commands that seem to be speaking directly to judges now apply to all of us personally, when judging ourselves. We should “not judge unfairly,” “show favoritism,” or “take a bribe,” (Deut. 16:19) in the evaluation of our own selves./\r\n\r\nIn a direct reversal of the self-enhancement bias and the above-average effect, Rabbi Feinstein suggests that even if we are in reality a Torah scholar or a righteous person, we should not assume that what we are doing is virtuous. Rather, we should view ourselves as a simple and average person and judge ourselves accordingly./\r\n\r\nOur inner lawyer can be very good at his or her job, effectively justifying our self-enhanced beliefs, defending us against seeing our faults, and making us seem better to ourselves than we are in reality. We are called on to counterbalance the defense attorney with a fair, righteous, and honest judge, who can help us ground our beliefs about ourselves in truth and reality. Doing so will help us stay appropriately self-aware, allowing us to improve and grow, and become more righteous individuals.'),
(52, 48, 'If a man will have a wayward and rebellious son, who does not hearken to the voice of his father and the voice of his mother . . . a glutton and a drunkard (Deut. 21:18-20)./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud says that the capital punishment of the wayward son was never carried out and is a technical impossibility. Why then does the Torah mention it? So that we will be rewarded for studying it (Sanhedrin 71a)./\r\n\r\nIs it logical to have a Jewish law that is a technical impossibility and is there only to be studied in theory? And what is the specific reward for this?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Elyah Lopian addresses this issue. He prefaces with a question. The Talmud says that the wayward son is a youth who steals to satisfy his gluttony and his craving for alcohol. The harsh punishment decreed by the Torah is not for the crime of theft, but because his behavior is certain to progress to the point where he will kill to satisfy his cravings./\r\n\r\nRabbi Lopian says that the Torah relates that when God provided water for Ishmael to prevent him from dying of thirst in the arid desert, the angels protested, “Why save him? His descendants will kill Jews!” (as we so tragically know). God responded, “I do not judge people by what may transpire in the future.”/\r\n\r\nWhy, then, is the wayward son punished for what he will do in the future?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Lopian answers that every person has freedom of choice in his moral and ethical behavior. Even a profligate sinner may do teshuvah, repentance. However, a youth who steals for food and drink has lost his freedom of choice. His cravings have overwhelmed his freedom of choice, and he is capable of eliminating anything that stands in the way of his gratifying his desires./\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with addiction recognizes the phenomenon Rabbi Lopian describes. An addict essentially loses his freedom of choice and becomes enslaved by his addiction. I have repeatedly heard recovered addicts say, “When I needed drugs, I did things that I never thought myself capable of doing.”/\r\n\r\nAny addiction can enslave a person, whether it be to alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or food. It is, therefore, extremely important that we take great precaution not to develop habits that can be destructive./\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for parents to know. It is not uncommon for parents to think that their son\'s frequent recourse to alcohol is a phase which he will outgrow. It is far more likely that the condition will progress to most serious proportions./\r\n\r\nWhen parents become aware of use of drugs or excessive use of alcohol in a child, it is a mistake to think that asking or ordering him to stop will be effective. He may have lost his freedom of choice. Parents should consult someone with established competence in addiction, and follow the advice they are given./\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the unrelenting course of addiction is a reward we receive from studying this portion of the Torah.'),
(53, 49, 'Our emotional experience sometimes seems to come out of nowhere. When we try to understand what makes us feel a certain way, we are sometimes left with more questions than answers. Varying theories exist to explain how and why we experience emotions. One such approach, which is gaining popularity in the field, is referred to as the cognitive theory of emotions. In short, emotions are generally based on appraisals and are tied to goals. Positive emotions, such as happiness, derive from an assessment, either consciously or unconsciously, that I am moving towards accomplishing a goal. Negative emotions, such as sadness or regret, are generated when a goal is blocked./\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons presented for why the horrible curses delineated in Parshat Ki Tavo could befall the Children of Israel is “Because you did not serve the Lord your G-d with joy and with goodness of heart when you had an abundance of all” (Devarim 28:47). Rabbeinu Bechaye and others understand this as highlighting the essential element of joy that should be present when serving God. Being happy while performing mitzvot is a vital and necessary component. This can be understood from a cognitive perspective, as being happy when following the Torah is a signal that our appraisal and goal systems are aligned with God’s commandments./\r\n\r\nYet, there are two strong arguments against such an understanding of the verse. First, as Rabbi Moshe Alshich contends, this doesn’t fit within the broader explanation for the curses that permeates the chapter. The reason given for the curses is that Bnei Yisrael wouldn’t be serving God at all, not that they were serving Him, but just didn’t enjoy the experience. Second, the punishment doesn’t seem to fit the crime. If the Children of Israel are keeping all of the mitzvot, but are just not happy while doing so, does it really make sense to punish them with such harsh curses?/\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of these questions, Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk understands the verse differently. The verse is not indicating that the punishment will come for not serving God with joy. The punishment will come for not serving God at all. Instead, the verse is explaining how the Children of Israel would devolve to a place where they wouldn’t be serving God, namely, because of the joy and happiness they were experiencing due to their material wealth and abundance of physical good. In a similar twist, the Yehudi HaKadosh of Peshischa also argues that not only would the Children of Israel not serve God at all but they would enjoy not doing so. The fact that they would enjoy a lifestyle not aligned with God demonstrates that their goals and appraisals would be distorted and misplaced./\r\n\r\nCommenting on the joy the Children of Israel experienced while sinning with the golden calf, Rabbi Moshe Alshich argues that it is one thing to violate commandments, but it is much worse to be happy about it. Ideally, he writes, by referencing the aforementioned verse, we should serve God with joy. If we do sin, the proper emotional response should be sadness and regret. Our goal is to serve God, and when we do, we should experience positive emotions. If we fail in our goal, we should feel a healthy amount of negative emotions to motivate us to fix the problem. Someone who is happy when sinning has no chance of repenting./\r\n\r\nAs we continue to traverse the month of Elul and progress towards the High Holy Days, we would do well to reflect on whether our goals are aligned with the Torah’s. If they are, we should experience joy and happiness that we are living a life of Torah and mitzvot. If they are not, we should feel a healthy amount of sadness and regret that should motivate us to try harder and improve our relationship with God.'),

Alzheimer\'s sufferers, stroke victims, even coma patients often respond to music in ways they can\'t even respond to their loved ones./\r\n\r\nThis is especially true when it comes to the shofar. The notes of the shofar affect several parts of the brain in a profound manner. It startles us into alertness and increases activity throughout the brain, propelling us into a heightened state of consciousness that allows us to see things clearly and act resolutely./\r\n\r\nFriends - the mitzvah of shofar on Rosh Hashanah requires active intentionality. It requires not just hearing the sound, but listening to it. Based on the Talmud, the Rambam rules that both the one who is blowing the shofar and the one who is listening to the shofar must have in mind that they are fulfilling a specific Torah obligation. But the Rambam goes a step further, emphasising the importance of attuning ourselves to its potent moral and spiritual message./\r\n\r\nHe writes: \"Even though the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah is a decree of the scripture, there is a hint in it which is to say \'awaken those who sleep from your slumber… search out your deeds and return in repentance and remember your Creator those who forget the truth in the emptiness of the time…\'.\" (Laws of Repentance 3:4)/\r\n\r\nThe shofar is a call to return to our best selves. It goes beyond the physical process of converting air vibrations into nerve impulses and then ordering them in our brain. It\'s an enriching, potentially life-changing intellectual, emotional and spiritual experience./\r\n\r\nSometimes, we cruise through life on autopilot, not thinking too much about what we say or do, not stretching ourselves to be better. The shofar is our Divine wake-up call. It can arrest our moral and spiritual slumber, jolt us into being present, jumpstart our lives. It can reawaken us to our priorities and purpose, and return us to a path of personal and spiritual growth. The moments of hearing the shofar being sounded in shul on Rosh Hashanah can become a truly deep spiritual experience for us, as we are literally hearing God calling out to us through the sounds of the shofar to become better people, to fulfil our potential./\r\n\r\nThe notes of the shofar are particularly specific. Essentially, the pattern is a straight sustained note (a tekiah), followed by a broken note (either a shevarim or a teruah), followed by another straight note. What is the significance of these notes? What does this pattern mean?/\r\n\r\nRabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch connects this sequence to the sounds of the chatzotzrot, the silver trumpets used to direct the movements of the Jewish people in the desert, where we journeyed for forty years after leaving Egypt. The straight blast, the tekiah, was sounded to call people to attention. The broken blast, the teruah, was an indication to the people to break camp - to dismantle their tents and pack their belongings and move on to the next place. This was followed by another straight blast, indicating that the time had come to proceed on their journey./\r\n\r\nIn the context of the shofar, Rabbi Hirsch explains that the first unbroken note, the tekiah, is God calling us to attention - to accept His authority in our lives and prepare to receive His message. The broken notes, the shevarim-teruah, represent breaking camp with our past selves, our entrenched bad habits. This requires doing a deep, honest reassessment of our lives, in terms of the Torah\'s values and principles, to determine what needs to be reinforced and taken with us on our new journey, and what we need to leave behind. The final straight note, the tekiah, is a call to move forward into the future with our new resolutions and a renewed sense of direction, aligned with God\'s will and our true, elevated purpose./\r\n\r\nLike our ancestors, we are on a journey in life. And that journey requires a map, a compass. Our Creator has put us on this earth for a particular purpose, and in order to ensure we fulfil it, we need His direction. In the same way the Jewish people in the desert needed to be alerted when to break camp and go forward, we too need that wake-up call to break from the harmful things we are doing, to find new, positive, productive things to do, and to journey forward in a new direction. The map and the compass of our lives is the Torah, but sometimes we forget that, and we need a reminder. The shofar is that reminder. It calls us to take note, to step away from the turbulence of day-to-day life and to hear the crystal clear call of God, the blast of the shofar that pierces our souls. It stops us in our tracks, and calls on us to disengage from all the things that we become attached to, all the extraneous things that are not part of the map of our lives. And it calls us to move forward, into the future, with determination and with conviction./\r\n\r\nThese three steps of the shofar - stopping, assessing, and moving forward - mirror the process of repentance itself, which the Rambam defines as regret for the wrongdoing of the past, disengagement with this wrongdoing in the present, and a resolve not to engage in this wrongdoing in the future./\r\n\r\nIt\'s interesting that in the blessing recited before the sounding of the shofar, we refer to lishmoa kol shofar - \"hearing the voice of the shofar\". The shofar isn\'t just a sound, it\'s a voice. It\'s a voice with an explicit message, something directly intelligible. We are called on to hear that message, not just in the sense of hearing the notes, but to listen intently and receive it. Listening is foundational in Judaism. The mission statement of the Jewish people is Shema Yisrael - \"Listen O\' Israel.\" We recite the Shema every day before we go to bed and when we wake up. We begin and end each day with listening./\r\n\r\nThis Rosh Hashanah, we will hear the sound of the shofar 100 times each day in shul. It is the sound that can awaken us. It is the sound that stirs us to look deep inside ourselves and make changes. It is the sound that opens the door and beckons us to a new, glorious future - to who we were meant to be. And all we need to do is listen.'),
(55, 51, 'How would you describe Yom Kippur? A solemn day? A day of prayer and supplication? A day of abstinence? The Mishna has a different description. It says Yom Kippur is a day of joy - in fact, one of the two happiest days of the year. This seems surprising to say the least. Yom Kippur is a day spent praying and fasting, and generally putting aside the things that bring us physical enjoyment./\r\n\r\nThe Talmud explains the happiness and joy of the day is because it\'s a day of forgiveness for our misdeeds, the opportunity to begin our lives afresh, free from the mistakes and wrongdoings of the past. It\'s the miraculous opportunity, in a sense, to go back in time and change history… our history./\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew word for repentance is teshuva, which literally means \"return\". Through teshuva, we return to that pristine state in which there was no distance or disconnect in our relationship with our Creator and with our fellow human beings./\r\n\r\nOf course, it doesn\'t just happen. Real repentance takes heart-rending effort and application. The Rambam, in his Laws of Repentance (Laws of Teshuva, 2:2), defines the process of repentance and sets out its various components: regretting the mistakes of the past, desisting from that wrongdoing in the present, resolving not to return to this course of action in the future, and finally, confession, an explicit verbal admission of all of our misdeeds./\r\n\r\nThe process of teshuva leads to forgiveness at any time in the year, but it has special power on Yom Kippur. As the Rambam writes: \"Yom Kippur is a time of teshuva for every individual and for the multitudes, and it is the climax of forgiveness… therefore everyone is obligated to do teshuva and to confess on Yom Kippur.\" (Laws of Teshuva, 2:7). On Yom Kippur, the force of Divine forgiveness is at its apex, and our heartfelt pleas for forgiveness are both more potent and more readily accepted./\r\n\r\nThe Rambam points out that the process of teshuva described above is sufficient when it comes to misdeeds that have damaged our relationship with God, but words and actions that cause harm to other people require an extra step. To rectify the harm done to others, we need to personally ask their forgiveness, as well as make any monetary restitution if we have caused them financial loss. Indeed, the Rambam says, based on the Talmud, that Yom Kippur does not atone for sins between one person and another unless that personal forgiveness has been granted. It is for this reason that, in the days leading up to Yom Kippur, it is customary to ask for forgiveness from whoever one may have wronged in the past year, so as to be able to access the gift of Divine forgiveness on Yom Kippur. The Rambam writes that it\'s important for the person who has been wronged to act with compassion and graciously grant forgiveness. In this way, the relationships that have been damaged by our wrongdoing can be fully restored./\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that the redemptive, purifying powers of Yom Kippur can only be accessed through real action and sincere intention - through a deep and meaningful teshuva process. This also explains why an important part of our Yom Kippur prayers is devoted to viduy - \"confession\". In each of the Yom Kippur Amidahs, there is a section devoted to confession. The fact that the confessions formula is embedded in the most intimate and personal of our prayers - the Amidah - indicates that our confession is meant to be a direct encounter with God, a moment of truth as we stand before our Creator, our defences down, without any pretensions of innocence./\r\n\r\nThe relationship between confession and the other components of the teshuva process is important to understand. The teshuva process is largely an internal process of transformation, buried in the heart and mind and soul of a person. Regret for the past and resolve for the future are a state of mind. It is the process of confession that gives verbal expression to the deep internal psychological and emotional process of personal change and repentance. The words of the viduy help us articulate and concretise the deep feelings of regret for the past and resolve for the future. By vocalising our misdeeds, we reinforce - and give shape and form to - the processes taking place deep beneath the surface./\r\n\r\nUltimately, we cannot just walk into the Yom Kippur experience without preparation. When we recite the various confessions before God on Yom Kippur, we need to have done the necessary spiritual and physical work beforehand. That is why Yom Kippur does not appear in the calendar in isolation. It is part of the Ten Days of Repentance, which begin with Rosh Hashanah and culminate with Yom Kippur. The hard work of teshuva begins, in fact, from the beginning of the month of Elul, the month preceding Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur./\r\n\r\nOne of the confessions we say on Yom Kippur is to acknowledge that sometimes we say a confession without meaning and intention, and this is something we have to be aware of and guard against. To merely mouth the words and assume it\'s an automatic pass to forgiveness and atonement is a critical mistake. Yom Kippur is the happiest day of the year because of its powers of forgiveness, atonement and spiritual cleansing - but it is a gift which is accessed through the real work of personal transformation./\r\n\r\nConfession also catalyses another dynamic, and that is self-transcendence. Rav Chaim Friedlander explains the source of most personality faults and wrongdoing in the world is selfishness and self-absorption. Egotism. Our sages call on us to transcend our ego, to concern ourselves with the well-being of others. The Gemara says we will find forgiveness and compassion from God when we are able to be compassionate and forgiving towards others. On a simple level, the Gemara is saying God deals with us measure for measure. If we show understanding, forgiveness and compassion to others, then He will do the same for us in return. But Rav Friedlander says it goes deeper. The capacity to show understanding, forgiveness and compassion to other people is derived from a capacity to transcend our ego. This self-transcendence imbues us with a holiness and purity and greatness, and it is this that brings about the Divine forgiveness./\r\n\r\nSo Yom Kippur is a day of achieving self-transcendence. We do so through our confessions, where we take a step back from our ego and look at ourselves objectively, acknowledging where we have made mistakes and where we can improve and how we can become better people. Doing so verbally and sincerely before God is a very powerful act of self-transcendence./\r\n\r\nThe other dimension of self-transcendence on Yom Kippur is to transcend the physical world by not partaking in food and drink, not wearing leather shoes, not washing or anointing with oils, or engaging in marital relations. That, too, is an act of transcendence - of transcending the pursuit of personal physical gratification that can sometimes weigh us down, and can distract us from the task of self-mastery that the day of Yom Kippur is all about./\r\n\r\nAbove all, Yom Kippur is a day of Divine forgiveness, a day of redemption and liberation from our mistakes and misdeeds. It is, in short, the happiest day of the year.'),
(56, 52, 'This week\'s Torah portion is actually a song that Moses told to the Jewish people. In one of its verses, Moses fortold the future and warned the Jews that they would:/\r\n\r\n\"become fat ... and ... desert God...\" (Deuteronomy, 32:15)/\r\n\r\nA LIFE LESSON/\r\n\r\nWhy does becoming fat - or having material success - lead to deserting God? The answer lies in a powerful human nature reality. This universal truism states that ego and success go hand in hand. When a person has success of any kind it can cause his ego to become instantly inflated./\r\n\r\nLet\'s walk through a typical cycle. If a person is down on his luck and believes in God, he\'ll ask Him to make things better. When God turns things around, this person is certainly connected and appreciative to the One who did it./\r\n\r\nOnce someone has success in a particular area of his lives, the Law of Attraction then comes into play. This Law, put simply, is that you will attract more of what you already have. So, when someone is successful it almost inevitably \"attracts\" and leads to more success. Success does beget success. This Law is at work in countless different areas of your life./\r\n\r\nAnd when the Law of Attraction kicks in, something fascinating happens: A person\'s ego springs into action. When the initial success that God gave to a person attracts more success, this person has a natural tendency to believe that it was he - not God - who got him the increased amount of success. His thinking - either consciously or sub-consciously - is that while God got him out of the starting gate, it was he who took the ball and made the most of the initial success./\r\n\r\nWhile this might be true, there\'s one key and crucial element missing in the thought process. Yes, you did work hard and you did make the most of the opportunities you had BUT it was God that allowed the success to come to you./\r\n\r\nThis last part is counter-intuitive and it\'s the exact thing that God is warning us against. Most people can see God\'s hand in their lives when they \"catch a break\" and something quickly changes and goes their way. But when they begin to ride their new found success to higher levels, they completely believe that it was their effort making the results happen./\r\n\r\nWhile a person must put forth effort, it\'s only because of God\'s desire as to whether or not he\'ll be successful. (An even more enlightened person takes this one step further and understands that even a person\'s own effort was made possible only because God allowed him to have the desire, strength, and ability to put forth this effort.)/\r\n\r\nWhen you live with the truism that God controls everything, it becomes incredibly liberating. This is because if you put forth the effort and don\'t get the \"success\" you desired it was only because God knows that at this point it\'s the perfect and precise outcome that\'s tailor-made for you./\r\n\r\nJust as you don\'t beat yourself up over the color of your eyes, the time the sun sets, or the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, so too, you don\'t beat yourself up if you don\'t succeed in a particular endeavor. Put in the necessary effort and then see what God thinks is best. (Therefore, those who live with this reality understand just how silly it is ever to lie, cheat, or steal in business.)/\r\n\r\nGod wants you to be successful and He very much wants you to use your talent and brains to become even more successful. He just also wants you never to look back and realize that you \"became fat ... and ... deserted God.\"/\r\n\r\nStart off this brand new year knowing Who\'s really filling in all the numbers on your check - and know that He wants to make it huge.'),
(57, 53, 'In this week\'s Torah portion - the very last one in the Torah - the Torah says that not only was Moses 120 years old when he died, but also:/\r\n\r\n\"...his vigor has not been diminished.\" (Deuteronomy 34:7)/\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIFE LESSON/\r\n\r\nMoses certainly lived a very long life. But in mentioning how Moses felt when he died - that his vigor had not been diminished - the Torah teaches us something just as important as the number of years a person lives. And that is how he lived these years. The happiness and contentment someone has during these years are just as important as the length of them. A person\'s age when he dies - while quantitative - isn\'t the sole measure of how a person lived. Rather, it\'s his years he lived plus his vigor and passion he had while living those years./\r\n\r\nPeople will disagree on many things. But there\'s one thing that universally everyone agrees on: we all want happiness. While we might have different vehicles we use to get happiness, nonetheless we all want the exact same thing. And right here, in the last Torah portion, God is telling us that the secret to true happiness is looking how Moses lived his life so we can have the same passion and vigor in ours./\r\n\r\nTo understand how Moses had vigor, passion, and happiness, let\'s first look at a segment of the population that generally don\'t have it: celebrities. Many people look at Hollywood stars with complete awe and child-like excitement. These famous people have the endless attention and admiration of millions of devoted fans. The obsession is so great that Internet sites are flooded when an Academy Award winner\'s discarded gum is about to be auctioned off./\r\n\r\nBut some of these very same celebrities commit suicide (either directly or slowly through non-stop destructive behavior) or simply go on to have unhappy, unfulfilling, and empty lives./\r\n\r\nWhy does it seem that fame and fortune has the potential to make people so miserable, especially when most of them have spent most of their lives day-dreaming, praying for, and working towards the very \"success\" they now have?/\r\n\r\nThe answer is found in basic self-esteem math which states that a person can only feel good about himself when he gives selflessly to others. When someone gives to others, he\'s automatically happy and feel energized about life. But if one takes from others, and essentially did nothing to earn what one is taking, then he will inherently feel like a fraud. It\'s that simple./\r\n\r\nSome celebrities are miserable is because they\'re takers. They\'re constantly being told how good-looking and talented they are. But these traits were given to them by God and they did nothing to earn them./\r\n\r\nImagine for a moment that in your hometown it was just announced that this coming Sunday, Main Street will be closed for a huge parade complete with massive floats and a marching band. And the reason for this unbelievable gala event is because of only one reason: The town wants to honor you! The police barricading the streets, the politicians in attendance, the news media carrying it live ... the entire event is taking place for all of the great and amazing things you\'ve done for your state and country. This Sunday is going to be your day! There\'s one small detail, however, that\'s known only by you. And that is, they actually have you confused with someone else. The accolades being showered onto you are for things you never did. How would you feel as you waved to all of your admirers from atop the lead float? Probably like a complete and total fraud. Outwardly, you\'ll play the part; but inwardly you\'d feel like a fool./\r\n\r\nCelebrities cannot walk down a street without being mobbed by countless fans who will do most anything to get within a few feet of their heroes. But what specifically did they do to earn this inexplicable admiration?/\r\n\r\nThe Torah teaches us that \"The reward is in proportion to the exertion\" (Ethics of the Fathers, 5.26). If someone exerts little effort for something but then revels in the lavish praise he receives from it, it can lead to low self-esteem and a sense of emptiness./\r\n\r\nThe surest and most direct path to happiness, fulfillment, vigor, and passion is to give selflessly for others and not take credit for anything you haven\'t earned yourself. This epitomizes exactly how Moses lives his life. While there are certainly many activities a person could engage in that will bring them pleasure, many of these experiences are as fleeting as a good night\'s rest. But giving selflessly permanently elevates your soul and therefore will provide you with an eternal \"happy feeling\" that you cannot lose./\r\n\r\nThis is the surefire way always to feel great and never to have your vigor be diminished. Whether you\'re a celebrity, businessman, or homemaker, take the unique gifts that God gave you and use them to give selflessly to others. It will make you feel like a real movie star.');
